I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Folks, this week is WordCamp US, and over the past week or so, I spent a fair amount of time talking to people about that first-time experience. And as with any person who&#8217;s talking about their version of a shared experience, I started thinking back to mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my first experience of WordPress was not typical, though. I had never even heard of WordPress when I first went to a WordCamp. I think, I think most of the time people have heard of it before, but I was just there for the plot. So, like many people in my generation, all of us old people of the internet, I was first online with things like Angelfire and GeoCities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> When I went to college, I was keeping friends and family up to date on what I was up to with a little, like, newsletter? And then Xanga made it to our college campus, and eventually, so did Facebook. And I was one of those kids kind of like half-breaking sites with HTML and CSS I found online. I was changing layouts like every week to suit my mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when I graduated and found myself in a city with more talent and more competition than I&#8217;d actually accounted for, and started to realize that this online stuff I&#8217;d been doing for fun might actually be something that I needed to use as a tool professionally. So, I first went out and reserved my screen name everywhere I could think of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we&#8217;re talking, like, LiveJournal, WordPress.com, Blogger, all the things, and eventually wound up building my first site on Weebly. And it was super ugly. I&#8217;m not able to design things. I have an okay sense for a design that is good, but like, left to my own devices, it&#8217;s gonna be what that was, which is like a tie dye background for some reason, and had everything organized into little, like, blocks, I guess? You know, like, old magazine layouts? And it technically had everything that I wanted, but it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best version of any of those things either. I could write a little bit about myself and my services, I could add a few photos, there was a way to contact me, and I could do it all by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was a good place to start. Not long after that, though, I graduated into the need for a more professional-looking website, and it was beautiful. I received a website; someone built it for me. It was beautiful; it had this elegant design. Had a lot of custom functionality, but it was built using ColdFusion. I couldn&#8217;t do anything to it. I couldn&#8217;t change anything. All minor changes just had to kind of wait until there was enough to make sense to use that maintenance time, that maintenance retainer that I had. It really was just kind of formal. It was an isolated snapshot of all of the sorts of information that was required to be on the web at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then, later that year, I went to my first WordCamp, and I moved my site over to WordPress. And for the first time, I had that kind of mixture of professional expression that was on top of something that enabled my own expression. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t learn much more about the software for a few years. It was doing what I needed it to do, how I needed it to be done, and that&#8217;s really what mattered to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I skip a few years ahead after that, a few years later, when I was learning by organizing Meetups and WordCamps that had speakers that I wanted to hear from, that had topics that I felt like I needed to learn more about, what I remember most about that learning period for me is that I knew that I wasn&#8217;t the first person to run into any of my problems, which meant that a solution was probably already out there, and I could find someone to come and teach us about their solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, I knew that if we were running into a new problem and started breaking things left and right, there was always a way back. I was never really too far away from success. Like I felt like I might be lost, but I still was pretty much findable. And I guess I always want that for new users of the open web now, like new members of our WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want them to feel like the breaking of things is fine and safe and that no mistake is irretrievable. I want us to have some place where perfection isn&#8217;t the point. Now listen, I know the software is complex right now. The admin is a little mismatched, your first choices are huge choices, and there are a million places to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, all I can say is, start with what you need, and once you&#8217;ve got that, like the back of your hand, move on to what you need next. And keep doing that, bravely and messily, until what you&#8217;ve got is all you ever wanted. I&#8217;m gonna leave for you, in the show notes, a link to something called WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s gonna launch a little WordPress site in your browser. There will be no host. It&#8217;s just all in the browser itself. And it will have the latest bundled theme on it, Twenty Twenty-Four, and the latest version of WordPress. And that&#8217;s it. Go in there and click around on the left-hand menu. Start a post, change a page, modify the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just play around a while. See if it&#8217;s something that seems fun to you or valuable, or if it&#8217;s something that you can use as a time capsule for your kid because that sounds like a nice little mix of fun and work. And remember, sometimes perfection&#8217;s not the point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folks, as I mentioned at the top, WordCamp US is happening this week. It is September 17th through 20th this year, quite a few more days. But that also means that we&#8217;ll have quite a bit more stuff to do. If you have your tickets and haven&#8217;t looked at all of the presentations occurring over the four-day event, remember to take a look at the schedule and pick out topics that are interesting. And remember, just because you picked it out before you went doesn&#8217;t mean that if you get in there and it doesn&#8217;t work for you. You can&#8217;t choose a different topic while you&#8217;re there. And as a bonus, if this is your first WordCamp that you&#8217;ve ever attended, I have you covered. You can check out my previous episode on all the things to remember for your first time attending a WordCamp. And we have a pretty active community as well. If you just have questions or want to get in there and say, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m going to a vegan restaurant for lunch; who wants to join me?&#8217; You can do that, and you can definitely find somebody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there are some upcoming WordPress meetings. So, if you&#8217;re not attending WordCamp US but still want to connect with the community, there are a ton of team meetings that are happening. You can find those on make.WordPress.org/meetings, I think. So really, really easy URL to remember. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I also wanted to just call your attention to a few really big projects that still need a little bit of help around the project. So, on the one hand, we have Data Liberation. That is still a really big project, but specifically, we are nearly ready to start working on some user-facing elements of that. It is being powered by Playground, and because the data liberation, the migration of one site to another, is so complex, once we get those elements built into Playground, I think it also stands to fix a bunch of the problems that we have across our user flow, our user experience for the project. Things like having better theme previews and being able to get a sense for what a plugin functionally will do for you versus what it says it&#8217;s going to do for you. And getting a sense for what the admin looks like, all of those things. And so, anyone who wants to learn more about contributing to Playground or to Data Liberation, I absolutely encourage you to go check out those meetings, see what&#8217;s happening, and get your hands a bit dirty with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We also have a bunch of stuff happening in our community space. If you had received this podcast from somebody because they were like, hey, I know someone who might like WordPress or who has just learned WordPress and has never been to an event or any other reason that you are listening to this but don&#8217;t yet know the community, there is an easier option than just jumping straight into a WordCamp like I did. You can go to a meetup. You can see there&#8217;s a widget in your dashboard that&#8217;ll tell you what your nearest event is, but if you put your location into that widget, and nothing comes up. Technically, that means that you have an opportunity to bring a bunch of people together to teach you stuff you wish you knew about your site right now. So you can wander over into your dashboard and see those, or you can also head over to the community area on make.WordPress.org and anybody over there is happy to help you get started. And let me tell you, it is a very low-effort sort of thing to do. Here again, perfection&#8217;s not the point. And so that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there is a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. Or tomorrow if we&#8217;re all going to WordCamp US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:58] (Music outro)</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17684\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Tour the New Learn WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/tour-the-new-learn-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 19:26:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17687\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:348:\"The reimagined Learn WordPress experience launched just over a month ago.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s been a while since I talked to you about the digital divide. In case you&#8217;re a brand new listener, check out episode 17, and actually everyone, just go check out episode 17 because bridging the digital divide, teaching people how to embrace technology fully and how to make it work for you, is one of the primary motivators of my decisions in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> WordPress&#8217;s unique position as both a tool that&#8217;s ubiquitous in its use and a community that is all-encompassing in its skill set means that if you know a bit about how open source works, you can use it as a tool to learn digital literacy and practice technical skills. Even though this is one of my primary motivators, I have never actually succeeded at getting WordPress into schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, it&#8217;s not for lack of interest from the community; it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s hard to fit into curriculum-based learning. After all, we&#8217;ve had ways to learn WordPress for as long as we&#8217;ve had ways to use WordPress. It&#8217;s just that it takes a long time to design instructional material, even when you know the content like the back of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And open source stuff just moves really quickly. However, that didn&#8217;t stop us from spending years refining the content that we do have into the learning pathways you can now find on learn.WordPress.org. If you&#8217;re an educator, you can use those almost out of the box. But if you&#8217;ve got learners in your home and want to make a case for why their school should bring a little WordPress based digital literacy into the classroom, I&#8217;ve got five good arguments for you for why they should give us a chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first one, as I mentioned before, WordPress as a tool is practically ubiquitous. It powers a significant portion of the web, so it&#8217;s easy to find examples to aspire to and content creators for guidance. And given that it is so prevalent, knowing WordPress ensures that students are well prepared for a wide range of job opportunities in the digital industry, making them more competitive in the job market overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is that WordPress is a free and open source piece of software. In our case, it&#8217;s free in both meanings of the word. Free, as in no cost and no constraints. That means students have freedom to experiment with the code and with the design, which gives you that feeling of joyous experimentation that a lot of us had at the start of the web before there were CMSs. It taps into a different kind of creativity that results in technical curiosity and, ultimately, growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that the best way to learn WordPress happens to also align with the concept of project-based learning, which is one of the best methods for learning in general. I believe that to be true. I&#8217;m not an educator, but I really believe that project-based learning is the best way to learn complex topics. It&#8217;s an active way to learn. You get a bunch of tactical skills in there, like development, alongside the basics of good collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Obviously, these are all skills that are directly valuable in the workplace, but I have also found them profoundly useful in my day-to-day existence. You know, as a human participating in a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four is a bit of a spicy nugget, but WordPress is essential for creating and managing digital content, which is table stakes right now. That&#8217;s a foundational skill for most web dev jobs, but also marketing, journalism, and communications. And beyond that, everyone knows that your best leaders are the people who can tell a compelling story based on the information they have. The ones who can connect the dots in a way that makes it matter to you. This is a spicy, of course, because of the confusing do si do that AI is taking with the content landscape. But I believe that people are the best storytellers, and stories are what keep us all moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing is that there is a whole wide world of open source. There are so many products and projects that use an open source license, right? Like you, listener, I can guarantee I don&#8217;t even know who you are, but I can guarantee that you use at least one item a day that has some open source thing in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of these open source projects are international. They&#8217;re developed on a global scale across numerous countries by people with various levels of education. And it&#8217;s this vastness of scope, this broadness of connection, that will give you, give your student, a chance to understand how to work across cultures, how to build something that is more than the sum of its parts, and how to embrace the concept of altruistic generosity that leads to a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Because just as I&#8217;m sure that you, a complete stranger, touched something open source today, I&#8217;m equally sure that the people we bring into open source will be able to solve the biggest problems of tomorrow with better connections and more skill because of what we taught them here today.&nbsp;If all of this sounds compelling, but you&#8217;re not ready to, like, go into your school administrator, your superintendent, your local, I don&#8217;t know, education board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this felt right, but you don&#8217;t know for sure, and you want a little bit more experience with it before you go advocate for it yourself, I will have in the show notes over on WordPress.org, I&#8217;ll have in the show notes of this podcast a series of events that are coming up. We have a couple that have already gone by WPCampus, I think just wrapped up a few weeks ago. But there are a handful of events that are happening across the world that is specific to youth wanting to learn technology, working with WordPress to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then educators as well. You can also always stop by the Training Team and ask them questions about how this all works, why it works together their philosophies behind their learning pathways. There are so many ways that you can get answers to the questions that you might have about why open source, and especially WordPress, is worth trying to get your students exposed to and working in and contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings me, now that I have finished with my little soapbox, to our small list of big things. Gosh, I hope you all missed hearing teeny tiny rants about WordPress and open source from me over the break that I took in August, but before you respond to that, feel free to respond to me in any comments. Let&#8217;s first get to the small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, the full WordCamp US schedule has been released, so if you&#8217;re planning to attend that, you can take a look and get your schedule, your personal schedule, for the week figured out. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence, there might be a speaker or two in there that tips the scales for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program Cohort number three, the third one, will happen in Q4 this year. The call for mentors and mentees has just been completed. But you should keep an eye out on September 9th, I think. So, at the end of this week, the final list will be announced. This program has been excellent for mentors to give back to the community while enhancing their leadership skills. And the mentees who participate have received personalized guidance and a chance to develop skills and network within the community, and a good portion of them continue to contribute to WordPress itself and other open source projects that we rely on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that YouTube has been an essential platform for sharing complex ideas with a diverse audience. And our WordPress YouTube channel is no exception. It has been slowly warming itself up. We have a team that&#8217;s warming up the content over there. WordCamp information gets on it now. But in keeping with our commitment to meeting the needs of both current and future users, just making sure that we meet people where they are, I&#8217;m excited to announce that Jamie Marsland will be taking on the management of the WordPress YouTube channel. So for anyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, stop by and say hello to Jamie in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, I have a really important call to action. So, we are still working to reactivate our meetup groups. The Community Team is driving that charge, and they need your help to reactivate any group that&#8217;s inactive. Last month, a list of groups was shared and marked for removal from our chapter program. And we requested responses by August 5th to keep those groups active, but due to the summer holiday, we have extended it a little bit. We&#8217;ve extended it to September 16th, which, if I am remembering my calendar correctly, is a couple weeks from now. So if your group is on that pending closure list, email support@wordcamp.org to let us know if you want to reactivate the group or if you are ready to step down and have a new leader show up, and we can help you figure out how to get that done. Either way, if you&#8217;re on the list, email us let us know what your hopes and, dreams, and plans are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:09:58]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

It brings a unified look and feel that’s modern, visual, and inviting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1024%2C919&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17613\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1024%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=300%2C269&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=768%2C690&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1536%2C1379&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=2048%2C1839&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond its fresh aesthetic, the new Learn WordPress site prioritizes learners with a revamped user experience consistent with familiar modern learning platforms. It features a new navigation menu, eye-catching thumbnails, and search filters so you can explore and discover content quickly. The clearer and more structured layout helps you easily recognize the resources you need (courses, lessons, Online Workshops) based on your learning preferences. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Learning Pathways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This redesign also highlights a new approach to Learn WordPress content, emphasizing what learners engage with the most. The introduction of Learning Pathways lets you grow your WordPress skills progressively. You can start with beginner essentials and then work your way through more advanced concepts at your own speed. This method lets you build a solid understanding as you move through each course. Learning Pathways are geared toward specific learners, like people using WordPress for the first time or those interested in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1536%2C1095&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=2048%2C1460&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Four Learning Pathways are already launched and ready to explore:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-user/\">Beginner WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-wordpress-user/\">Intermediate WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-developer/\">Beginner WordPress Developer&nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\">Intermediate Theme Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can look forward to more Learning Pathways in the User and Developer tracks soon.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Last week, we released WordPress 6.6, and I had a chance to chat with a long-time contributor and member of the Release Squad about it.&nbsp;Today, I have with me Meher, and she was, well I guess I will let her tell us what she did with the release, but at the time of this recording, yesterday we had the WordPress 6.6 release, codenamed &#8216;Dorsey,&#8217; and so Meher, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Meher:</strong> Hi, thank you for inviting me. It&#8217;s nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:01:09]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you do in the WordPress project, how long you&#8217;ve been contributing, and then the role that you played in our big, big mid-year release?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Meher:</strong> So my name is Meher. I&#8217;m a front-end developer. I&#8217;m also a CEO of KDC. I&#8217;m also a codable expert in WordPress. I started with contributing into the marketing field. Then, slowly, for 5.6, I got to be on the release squad, learned about training, about how the release goes, process happens. From that time onwards, I&#8217;ve been part of marketing or, basically, I&#8217;ve been part of the marketing team for all the releases. For 6.6, I picked to do the Release Coordinator, something different, something new, wanting to know what goes into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That is a big leap from like hanging out in marketing to going to be the Release Coordinator. Before we get into the release itself, just what made you think to yourself, I would like to do that? I would like to stand up and wrangle all of these contributors across the world. Make sure we get a release out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> I wanted to try something new. Like even in WordCamp, each role is different. So, even in the release, I wanted to try each different things. And like 5.6, I was in documentation. Then, I was in marketing. So then I got used to marketing, so I stick with my, no, I stuck with marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:40] <strong>Meher:</strong> So this time, I want to try something different, and I want to see, you know, how easy was it to be a Release Coordinator because it&#8217;s a Release Coordinator, see, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a like a big thing coordinating so many people so many different teams going on, working together, and so yeah, it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. I&#8217;m glad that you found it fun. I always worry when people make big shifts. I&#8217;m like, did we put enough documentation to make it clear? Are they going to find it easy to get started or not? And I think you did a really great job with it. So congratulations, since that happened just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes, less than 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So, from your position as the Release Coordinator, what are the biggest, like, one or two features that you really were excited to see get in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, one of the biggest features was the style override patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] <strong>Meher:</strong> Which I found very useful because a lot of people are using patterns. So, you know, patterns override; if you wanna change something on a specific page, it&#8217;s really useful then just to, you know, recreate a second pattern and then to match up and all. And second, which I liked as a user, was the publish box on the post becoming very clear, very, you know, cluster-free, very minimalistic, and just so comfortable that a normal user will actually understand what is there instead of going to each dropdown and figuring out what needs to be done. So, for me, I think as a developer and user, these two are the fun features, which I like, which 6.5 had, so. There are many other features as well. These are the two great features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I don&#8217;t think that anyone can argue about the importance of making things a little easier to see, a little easier to use. It&#8217;s been a little bit since WordPress was like fall into it easy to use. I feel like we have been the easiest of the robust CMS systems for like a long time. I know I said CMS systems. That&#8217;s like saying pin number. I know that the S in CMS is systems, but anyway, that notwithstanding, we&#8217;ve been the easiest of the complex solutions for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s always great when we, when we take a moment to be like, what could we make a bit easier to just like, no instructions required you get in there and you can tell like, what any individual thing will do without necessarily, like you said, having to go into drop downs and reading a bunch of stuff a little guesswork is okay. And also, it&#8217;s clear that none of it is dangerous. And so I think that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s a a good change myself. So, I agree with your assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So the style override patterns, that&#8217;s part of the suite of design tools that we&#8217;re pulling together, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> in your experience, you said you&#8217;re the CEO of your company, like in your experience, does that feel like something that&#8217;s super useful for agencies or particularly useful for freelancers, or should it generally be useful for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] <strong>Meher:</strong> It will be useful from a small business point to a freelancer as well because we always try, like, in each page, we always, you know, there is some bits repeated, you know, so, patterns makes it easier, and syndicate pattern makes it more easier so that you can just duplicate and have one place to change. And, like, you have ten pages, you have one pattern across ten pages. The 11th page, you want the same pattern, but little change in that. It&#8217;s easier. It&#8217;s good because you can just change on that page, one particular thing and still go in the parent and change other things to reflect in that. So it will be very helpful for freelancers, small agencies. I do see big agencies take advantage of it. So overall, it should help everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Good. Good. I, for one, isn&#8217;t it great when we can get a feature out that mostly is going to help everyone. But I have been especially interested in the features that we&#8217;re trying to get out that help that kind of like small to medium agency area. I feel like we have a lot of folks in the WordPress community who do exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re getting something together. You have a mostly what you need across your site. You have one style that&#8217;s out there, but there&#8217;s this one area that you want to have a little bit more personality or a little less personality, depending on what your client is looking for, like this one is applying for jobs, and it needs to be a little less exciting or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great that we have that option. So you don&#8217;t have to try to, I don&#8217;t know, hack your way through that. I know that we&#8217;re not a super get-in-there-and hack-on-it sort of group anymore these days, but I love that we still have that feeling of we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re going to make this a safe hacking space for you. Just get in there and make it work. So that&#8217;s excellent. Excellent. So for you, then, personally, cause you wear a lot of hats, you&#8217;ve your front-end developer; you&#8217;re running your company, you&#8217;re working, you&#8217;re a codable expert. You&#8217;ve got all these things. So from your perspective, what is the thing that got into this release that was a surprising, like a diamond in the rough for you, like a surprising good feature when you just thought it was like an important feature at some point? Was there one that seemed like it was a good idea but became a great idea by the time it was out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, I would say style variations because I did not expect the final style variation to be what it is. A theme developer can create the theme, can add styles, can add fonts, can give different design elements to the theme as a normal user when they when someone wants to just pull up a website, but they&#8217;re not good in design, or they don&#8217;t know which font to use. They choose which font, but then it doesn&#8217;t work. So if the theme provides an easy option just to shift the different styles they&#8217;re using and combining with the fonts. It is a much bigger opportunity for everyone because a normal user can just, they have a black and white site. I want to shift to a colorful site. Just go and see what the theme art has given you and shift it. So I think that I was surprised and I like the outcome. I&#8217;m sure my blogger friends also will like it because then they don&#8217;t have to depend on a designer to you know, give them color schemes and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. Yeah. So unrelated. It&#8217;s only, it&#8217;s kind of related. I shouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s unrelated. It&#8217;s all about WordPress. And now it&#8217;s about color palettes. So, I have a new design on my blog. And unfortunately I am the sort of person that does need a designer to tell me what I meant by the thing I thought. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">And so, like, I had this idea of the sort of color palette that I wanted and was searching for color palettes inside themes, which I was not succeeding at.</span> And eventually I had a designer who was happy to help you figure this out and get something out there. And they got me something that&#8217;s absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s got an excellent color palette and they redid some images for me. So it looks nice and hip and feels kind of modern. I think it&#8217;s great. But the one thing that I consistently felt confident to mess with while I was in there, because I think they did some custom work in there too, is all of the stuff that&#8217;s included in style variations. Like, I&#8217;m not touching colors because I can&#8217;t put colors together to save my life. But I was pleasantly surprised also by that particular feature. It gives you a feeling of I can change the face of this through the fonts or whatever it is. And I think that&#8217;s a nice, a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> And it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a perfect combination. Color and font. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t know today&#8217;s time which font is good. Or which font is needed for an industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. Fortunately, I&#8217;m a site manager of one. And so I just had to ask myself if I liked the font and moved on from there. So, oh. So, like I said, as we&#8217;re recording this, we are less than 24 hours past the release. How was your experience with this release? Was it enjoyable? Did it like expand your horizons? Were there surprises in how a release is run?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:43] <strong>Meher:</strong> There was no surprises because I&#8217;ve already been a part of a release. So I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s&nbsp;fair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Meher:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s depends on what happens on the day.&nbsp;But yes, behind the scenes, following up, just checking in to make sure, are we on time, do we need more time, or what needs, you know, how much more time is required. It was fairly good, I was only clearly concerned about on the day of the release, because there&#8217;s a lot of things to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Meher:</strong> Usually, the party of the beta and the RCs finish in less than hour or so. But the final has a lot more detailed steps and many people to ping, to get, you know, them on the day of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, for folks who have never watched a release happen. So, I think a lot of the folks who listen to this podcast, they find it in the dashboard, they don&#8217;t necessarily contribute to WordPress. But, like, if you&#8217;ve never watched a WordPress release, we have these release parties for every beta that goes out, every release candidate that goes out, and then the general release. And I always find them so fascinating because, we have hundreds of contributors over the course of an individual release. And then we have probably 50, 60 people who show up at, for some of you all, in the middle of the night and are just being directed, like their attention is just being directed here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I love watching it because I, I&#8217;m always in the release channel. I&#8217;m in the core channel. All of these are in Slack. And then I&#8217;m also in the admin channel where you have to do the flipping of switches and packaging things. And it&#8217;s really interesting to see, almost like a scan of a brain where things are lighting up for various things. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">Like, you do the pre-testing in the release channel, and then you do the general testing in the core channel.</span> And then we&#8217;ve got like a person who&#8217;s flipping switches in the back, in the admin area to make sure that it all gets together. And it&#8217;s just really interesting to see how it all works. And yeah, it&#8217;s a really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listener, if you have never, if you&#8217;ve never done this, you have another opportunity. And I think the next release is early in November or something. And even if you&#8217;re there as like a spectator, not necessarily ready to take part in the release, sometimes it&#8217;s kind of nice to see how much effort and how many people are showing up to work on any individual release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:13:01]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;This was your first time to lead the release parties, though, right?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes. My first time releasing a release party. Also, to the spectators who have never been a part of release, you can just come and say hi. Like, yesterday, on the day of the release, there was one participant who joined for the first time, and she did contribute.&nbsp;And she was amazed by how smooth it went through. And for me, the best part of any release is seeing the green tick when people start testing. So, you know, everything is smooth sailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Meher:</strong> And we&#8217;ll reach the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s, it is a real testament to how well and how closely all of these folks can work together, which if you stop and think about the fact that everybody&#8217;s like all over the world, it&#8217;s all across the globe that this is happening. It is why WordPress works, right? All of these people, all of you coming together to do this on behalf of this software. How cool that you had somebody who joined for the first time and then they were able to contribute immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:04] <strong>Meher:</strong> Also, there are a lot of folks who&#8217;ve done it. So they&#8217;re always ready to help out. You know, if you&#8217;re stuck somewhere, as a first-time release lead, there were certain questions I had. There are a lot of people to guide you to the right direction or to say, this needs to go here, or you need to tell the audience this. A lot of support you get from the squad itself, plus the people who are not on the squad and who&#8217;ve done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Absolutely. I remember the first release that I led I was the coordinator of it and I believe it was 5.0. I believe it was the one that we put Gutenberg in core with, and it was the most terrifying thing I&#8217;d ever done. Not because I hadn&#8217;t been watching these releases happening for years, but because it&#8217;s different participating and watching and then being the person who is like you said, like making sure that things are still going on time that you understand when you need to say, like, there&#8217;s no way that this works for users right now. We have to take it out and all those things. And then, yeah, the day of, the first time that you have to run one of those global meetings, be like, &#8216;everyone, we don&#8217;t have time for this. Move on&#8217;. That&#8217;s always a really hard first time. Well, cool. That&#8217;s so exciting. So I have a last question for you, and that is, you&#8217;ve kind of let us into it, for first-time contributors to a release, especially anyone who&#8217;s thinking about joining the release squad for the first time, do you have any advice, anything that you wish you had been told when you were coming into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Come with an open mind and come with a thought that there are people to help you. Ask in any channel. There will be someone or the other who will answer you immediately or a little later, depending on the time zone, and will guide you to the right person or right documentation where you can read up because there is a lot of documentation, good documentation on releases, how it handles and what team is needed, what they are supposed to do. So, you, you have a friendly bunch of people. Just ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. I love it. I love that advice. That was really good advice. Don&#8217;t be scared. Everybody has answers, and they want to give them to you. I agree. That is a real strong truth for the WordPress project. Last thoughts: anything you want to share with the WordPress community with our community of listeners here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> Looking forward for new people joining the next release and seeing 6.7 new features, which I&#8217;m excited about, collaborative phase three coming into picture and excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So you can come join us, make.WordPress.org/core, or you can join us in the Slack instance. You can go to chat.WordPress.org and get signed up for that. We coordinate all of this in the core channel, and we hope to see every new contributor that&#8217;s been on the fence. We hope you show up. There&#8217;s a new meeting every two weeks just for y&#8217;all. Meher, this has been an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:56] <strong>Meher:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:58] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hopefully, you&#8217;ve had a chance to download the release and try it out on your own sites. As always, if you run into any bugs, let us know so that we can get them in the next point release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. I have a moderate-sized small list. The first one is that WordPress is a reminder, actually. It&#8217;s a lot of reminders this week if I get right down to it, but this first one is a reminder that one of our big-picture goals for 2024 was getting new users into our event series. Our goal, of course, is to warmly welcome more first-time attendees and new users, and future WordPressers at all of our events, and that&#8217;s something that you can help get done. So, for all of our event organizers, or if you have not organized an event yet and would like to, just so that you can meet the fellow WordPressers in your area or, get to grow your own network a little bit. We&#8217;ve got a few best practices that can help you to make sure that you have a good experience for first time attendees. For one, you should always consider some thoughtful event design. Craft your events with some first-time attendees in mind. You have to consider their needs and interests and potential barriers to participation. Second, it helps to have some targeted messaging. Ensure that you have promotional materials that highlight the benefits of attending, but also what new knowledge, skills, or professional connections folks will gain when they come. It&#8217;s also good to share success stories of past first-time attendees. And then just kind of a final note for that on outreach strategies. You should experiment with a range of marketing channels to reach professional new attendees. You can partner with local schools, professional organizations, and online communities who can help to spread the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on our small list of big things is a reminder that the Docs Team holds an online Contributor Day every fourth Tuesday. They&#8217;ve been doing this for about a year now. And I think that it&#8217;s one of the most engaging and fun new contributor experiences we have, which I realize might sound odd for documentation, but it&#8217;s a great team. It&#8217;s got a great number of team reps in it. And they&#8217;re looking for you. They&#8217;re looking out for you to come and join for your first time on a Contributor Day. The next one is actually tomorrow, July 23rd. I&#8217;ll have a link for that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the third thing on our list is a reminder about online workshops. These are live sessions where you can learn alongside other WordPress enthusiasts, and they&#8217;re, you know, safe spaces where you can come as you are, develop new ideas, explore issues that you&#8217;re having, ask questions, network over shared interests, exchange theories, collaborate, and honestly, thrive on a bit of problem-solving together. New workshops are happening all the time. You can check out the schedule to join in on a live session and even watch some of the previous sessions to see if it&#8217;s for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the final thing on our list is that there is a recap up of the first Media Corps Briefing that was held on June 27th, and it provided media partners with an overview of the Source of Truth and updates that were planned for WordPress 6.6, that was released last week. Obviously, we just talked to Meher about it. But that particular session featured guest Anne McCarthy, who explained and demoed some of the upcoming features and answered a bunch of questions from the participants. The briefing was recorded and published on the WordPress YouTube channel. Apart from the recording, you can also find a summary, the full transcript, and other relevant links from the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:20:42]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

So the temperatures—last time we spoke, the temperatures were really chilly in Sydney, but now they&#8217;ve come all the way back up. So high twenties, almost 30 degrees, which is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Wow. Yeah. Well, that sounds like Indonesia, but I feel like it&#8217;s been really, really hot in the last few days. So what&#8217;s chilly by your standard for Sydney?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Probably 10 to 12 degrees during the day. That’d be cold, and close to zero at night, but that&#8217;s nothing compared to where I&#8217;m from in Scotland. So that&#8217;s a lovely summer&#8217;s day—2 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />It&#8217;s nothing, right. Alright. And then how is it going with WordCamp Sydney? So, I heard that this is going to be the camp that everyone in Australia and probably New Zealand too—they&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for years. When was the last time of WordCamp Sydney or WordCamps in Australia? If you can share with us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The last WordCamp in Australia was 2019. I believe it was WordCamp Sydney in 2019, and Perth was due to go ahead in 2020, but that obviously got canceled when COVID struck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Right, right. So, five years, I would say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Five years, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />The last WordCamp Sydney. So I bet everyone is so looking forward to it. And I am guessing also that everyone across Australia is joining forces to help you make it happen. Can you say something about it? How many organizers and where are they from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We&#8217;ve got 12 organizers, which is a huge team, but I wanted to get a lot of people involved from all over Australia. So I&#8217;ve got people from Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney. I think there&#8217;s somebody in Canberra. So, it’s basically all over the major cities, and that&#8217;s really nice. There are a lot of new people on the team. The idea is to train them up and just show them how a conference works, how it&#8217;s organized, so that they can then maybe go back to their own cities and think about putting on a WordCamp in their local city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That’s the way to go. So, is this your second, third, fourth, or fifth WordCamp Sydney as an organizer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />2014, 2016, 2018, 2019… Yes, fifth one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Oh wow. You&#8217;re the master of WordCamp Sydney then, and it is about time for you to prepare the next generation, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Right. Someone&#8217;s got to train them up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Exactly. Of course, you’re still around, and they would probably be happy to see you around and helping them out, but I think the younger generation is probably also excited to take up the leadership baton. Wow. And when is it going to happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />November the second and third, which is a Saturday and Sunday, and we are at the University of Technology, Sydney—or we call it UTS—at one of the buildings there. We’ve hosted previous WordCamps in that building, so we kind of know our way around. It was a safe bet rather than trying something new. It is more of a kind of rinse-and-repeat just so we can focus on the event and not on different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Exactly. So you focus on the content, the organizing of the event, and it allows you also to ensure that all the organizing team understands what it takes to hold an event WordPress style. And so two days—let us know what’s going to happen in those two days. Are you going to have Contributor Day on the first day or the second day, or no Contributor Day at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />I don’t think we’re going to have a Contributor Day at all. I don’t think any of the WordCamps in Australia have done a Contributor Day, but one of the reasons we chose not to do it was because of the budget. Since it’s been five years since the last WordCamp, we weren&#8217;t too sure how many sponsors we&#8217;d get on board. So we just wanted to do the minimal that we could—the two days. If we do get extra sponsorship, then there’s nothing stopping us from hiring another day or another office somewhere and doing a Contributor Day. We can talk about that. Sponsorship’s looking pretty good just now, so yeah, it’s something we can consider and spin up if need be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, so let’s talk about the schedule first. In those two days, what can people expect? Are there going to be full sessions, are there going to be discussions or workshops? And then later on, we’ll touch upon the sponsorship. So what can we expect from the two days of WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />It’s going to be two tracks of talks. There may be a panel discussion on one day, but it’s generally going to be two tracks with people talking—slides and sessions. We did think about workshops, but that’s a level up. To do a workshop is quite demanding. You’ve got to have the people there, the resources, the technical equipment. So it’s a different technical challenge from just putting on a talk session. So it&#8217;s something the organizing team is thinking about—how could we implement that for the next WordCamp. We’ve had huge discussions about that, but probably not this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay. And you mentioned two tracks. What are they? Is this the common tech and non-tech split?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />No, no, we’re going to mix it up. We started mixing up the tracks, I think, in 2018. We’ve tried in the past to do beginner and dev, or technical and non-technical, but it really depends on the speaker submissions that we get. So we don’t get hundreds—I think we got about 76 speaker submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That’s quite a lot! Wow, congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, but a lot of them are very developer-focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />So we’re just going to mix it up. We’ll have some dev talks in one room, some dev talks in another, some beginner stuff. So we’ve got people working on the schedule now, going through the speakers. That’s the point we’re at the moment—speaker applications are finished, and we’re reviewing, vetting, and creating the schedule, which should be out in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, so for now we can only expect talks, but who knows? There could be panels or workshops—it depends on the resources, sponsorship as well. And you’re vetting the applications at the moment—out of 70, are you going to reduce it by half or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />There are about 30 slots available over the two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, that’s quite a lot! So many people are looking forward to it, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, that’s good. You mentioned that most of the submissions are developer-focused. This was also one of the inputs that the community team received when we were experimenting with Next Gen events—where some folks were expecting to learn more about developer topics. So, globally, what do you think the expectation or the hope from the community in Australia or the neighboring countries is? What’s the interest at the moment? Do you consider those feedback where people want to hear about certain topics or get involved in certain discussions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, I did a survey for all the meetup groups—maybe two years ago or a year and a half ago. We did get a good development response from that, but we also got quite a large beginner and business response as well. That’s been reflected at the meetups, certainly at the Sydney one. We’re getting quite a few beginners, and we’re getting more business owners coming along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Oh, that’s good, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We&#8217;ve got people saying, &#8220;We run a website; we want to know more, expand on that.&#8221; So it’s a mix of topics. We’ll definitely cater for beginners, we’ll definitely have some business talks in there, and we’ll try to pad out the development side—we’re okay for development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Good, good, good. And were these submissions coming from other tech community folks? Something related to WordPress? Did you find any in your submission?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yes, absolutely. So we’ve got Girls Who Code—I think we got a submission from them—the Linux Australia open-source community. We had some submissions from them as well. One of the people on the organizing team is a Drupal person, so his community was involved as well. We’re touching on a lot of different communities, a lot of different meetup groups across Australia to advertise. As we said, this is the first one back in five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />So everyone’s excited and wants to be part of it. If not, they just want to see people again, network with people. That sounds exciting—I’m also looking forward to being there. I just have to book my hotel and my flight. It’s two months to go, but I’m still thinking, &#8220;Oh, do I have to spend more just to hang out with folks?&#8221; It sounds like a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me. Although I’ve been to Australia—I lived in Melbourne for two years, but I haven’t quite been to Sydney. I visited my</p>\n\n\n\n<p>relatives in Sydney a bit. So yeah, looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let&#8217;s go back to sponsors. You mentioned that things are looking good. Are you still in need of more? Do you have a deadline, or are you open to receiving last-minute sponsorship? What’s the situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We’ve got the big sponsor package levels, and they always take a lot longer because the bigger companies move a little bit slower. There are a lot more red tape and hoops to go through. So I think we’re okay on the big sponsorships—we’re really looking for more local sponsorships at the moment. So, around the silver, gold, and bronze levels, so we can get that local sponsorship as well, rather than just from all the big companies. We have 93.41% of our expected income from sponsorship at the moment. We can always use more—if we get more, we can open up more rooms, get more speakers, and do workshops or other types of sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, so we’re looking very good at the moment. Ticket sales are actually pretty good. We&#8217;ve got—just having a look—we&#8217;ve got 60, 65, 66 tickets sold so far, and that’s with no real push or advertising or speakers. The maximum attendee limit is 333—that’s the venue maximum, so we’re looking okay at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay, well, you still have two months to go, and then you’re going to publish all the schedules, speakers probably. So all these sponsors—sponsors also drive people’s decisions. They want to check out the latest products or they just want to connect with their brands, or in fact, they want to give feedback on the product they’ve been using. This is a chance at WordCamp, the networking happens between companies and the customers as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The networking side has always been huge at the WordCamps in Australia. There are people who will come just to sit out in the corridor and chat to people, and not listen to any sessions, which is fine by us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, how do you call that? Oh, I can’t remember. How do you call that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The water cooler?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />It’s the session that happens in the corridor. There’s a term for it, but I can’t think of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Hallway track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Hallway track, there you go! Yes, the hallway track. That’s usually the most favorite one, especially for an event like yours. People have been waiting, and they are excited just to be there, I would say. If not, they are also interested in hearing the latest updates in the industry. Right. Alright. So, I also want to hear more about the community in Australia. Is there anything that we can learn from? How is everything in both Australia and the neighboring New Zealand and the Pacific? There are WordPress communities in these regions, but I think WordCamp Sydney has been the only WordCamp, at least after COVID, that has happened in that part of the world. What do you think about it? How can we support more communities around the region to be more excited to come up with—probably doesn’t have to be as big as WordCamp Sydney with 200-something people, but even 50 to 100 people—we’re so supportive of that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, no, that’s a great point. Obviously, with COVID, the whole community was fragmented and decimated. We lost meetup groups, so I worked with Automattic and WordPress Community Support to spin up those meetup groups again. So we’ve got meetups happening in some of the big cities, which is great. We’ve got Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth going again with new organizers—fresh talent, which is always great. More meetups are spinning up. We’re always encouraging people that if you want a meetup in your local area, we’re here to help. It’s not as scary as it first seems, and it doesn’t have to be an event with speakers or presenters. It can be in a library or a coffee shop, just chatting. So we’re really encouraging people to spin up local meetups and tailor the community for where it’s at. During COVID, we went online for a couple of years with the WordPress Sydney Meetup, and it worked very well. But maybe it worked a little too well, because it’s a long way to commute. If you&#8217;re outside the Sydney suburbs, it’s like an hour and a half to come into the city center for maybe an hour’s chat. The other cities are the same. So there are a lot of people who really liked the online sessions or being able to watch them at home and catch up. We’ve lost a lot of community members that way, but I’m trying to encourage people that the networking and social side are just as important as the topic or the talk. So I’m encouraging people to meet up and create more local meetups. We had three or four around Greater Sydney before COVID, and some were just a handful of people meeting up in a coffee shop. But that’s great! That’s what we want to encourage—more local meetups rather than always having big WordCamps. If we can build up the community at a local level, the WordCamps and everything else will just take care of themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, I agree. Right. And do you have anything planned for WordCamp Sydney where you gather all these meetup organizers, or you open up either a discussion or booths for those people who are interested in joining the local community? How do you use WordCamp Sydney as leverage to boost these local initiatives? Is there anything in the plan for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />In 2019, I had little sessions in—it was basically a hallway track. So we had little sessions, and one was Gravity Forms, one was maybe WooCommerce, and just a handful of people would sit down, and we’d chat about something. So I&#8217;d like to do something similar, but along the lines of community and specifically WordPress meetups. So if people are interested, they can come and sit down just for a chat, and I’ll have a skeleton overview of how you can boot up a local WordPress meetup, what types you can do, how to get funding—all that sort of stuff. So I plan to do a little bit of that, a little bit of an unconference, just sitting down with a group of people. But we’re also going to mention the meetup groups at the event as well, because there’ll be a lot of probably ex-meetup organizers there. So there’s a huge talent pool in that room, and a lot of veteran meetup and conference organizers there too. It’d be a bit silly not to engage them. We’ll definitely promote that side as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds terrific. And I know that the meetup group in Perth has been one of the most active. I was recently in touch with one of the members—I think they’re also speaking at the meetup. With their connection to some community in China, they helped a couple of groups join the official chapter program. So we have Shenzhen Meetup Group now, and there’s an application from Shanghai and others. So, that’s the power of connection. We’re talking about networking, and thanks to folks in Australia, we now have WordPress meetup groups in China. So even small events like a meetup can lead to big achievements as a global community. I’m looking forward to seeing what WordCamp Sydney will result in. Recently—actually yesterday—I saw this social post from the WordPress account, where Josepha Haden was talking about WordPress and education. In some parts of the world, mainly Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, there are WordCamps or WordPress events that involve students—university students, kids, and the younger generation in general. Is there any direction that you’re introducing at WordCamp Sydney, whether through the session topics, the speakers, or any activities that would involve or allow kids to join and participate? If not, that’s totally fine, but if yes, or if there’s still an opportunity—given that there’s still sponsorship available to support your event—this could be something interesting for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />It’s definitely something we discussed, but we’re not going to do a kids track this year. Again, we’re just trying to keep it as simple as we can to test the model again, to see if it still works. So there’ll be no kids track, but certainly students. I’ve contacted some people that I know in TAFE to try and get that student side as well. Also, one of our sponsors is offering travel grants on an application basis. I think they’re offering 10 travel grants, particularly for people who can’t afford to get into the city, like students. That’s on the website homepage—you can have a look at that. But that’s to encourage people who would maybe like to come to WordCamp but can’t quite afford it or don’t have the finances. So, students would definitely fit into that category. We’re encouraging that. We’ve always had a strong student membership, because local colleges use WordPress a lot in their courses to spin up a website and do projects within WordPress. So we’ve always had that strong student connection, and we want to grow that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds good. There’s a lot of opportunities. It’s great that you have sponsors willing to offer travel grants for WordCamp Sydney. Okay. This is fantastic, and I hope that all the seats are taken by those who are really in need of the support and who will benefit from your event. This is fantastic. Alright, so where can we learn more about Word</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camp Sydney, other than the website? Are you on social media?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yes, we’re on social media. Let me just pull it up. The hashtag is <a rel=\"tag\" class=\"hashtag u-tag u-category\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/tag/wcsyd/\">#WCSyd</a>. We’re on X (formerly Twitter) as WordCampSYD, and we’re on Facebook as well—same handle. We’re also on LinkedIn. If you just search for WordCamp Sydney, it’ll come up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Right. I’m actually scrolling down—usually where you see the social buttons, and I see Meetup is the first button, then Facebook, then X, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. This is a set of social accounts for WordCamp Sydney—wow! Who’s the person, who’s the organizer behind this communication or marketing? Kudos to that person. This is awesome. And I see that you are collaborating with Linux Australia. This is, I think, a very unique setup. I don’t think this is evident in many parts of the world. There are some communities collaborating with local tech communities, but WordCamp Sydney, or WordPress in Australia, has been one of the experiences in this kind of collaboration. Is there anything you can share about this—when you started, how you started this collaboration, and how you maintain it? Of course, there would be probably some admin involved or hiccups in the collaboration—that&#8217;s the dynamic, right, of teamwork. I see this as teamwork and collaboration to keep the WordPress community alive in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />So we’ve got a memorandum of understanding between WordPress Community Support or WordCamp Central and Linux Australia. Linux Australia supports all the open-source communities in Australia. They’re huge and very helpful as well. They run our event insurance, and we run the bank accounts through Linux Australia too. This means we don’t have to deal with currency exchange rates, and the insurance here in Australia—to get a venue—you usually need $20 million in insurance coverage. WordCamp Central, I believe, can only do $10 million. So, Linux Australia covers us for event insurance. They’ve been fantastic supporters. As well as having our WordPress community in Australia, we’re also linked into the whole open-source community via Linux Australia. So we’re broadcasting out to all of Australia, not just to the WordPress niche. They&#8217;ve been absolutely fantastic. It does mean a little bit more admin—we have to form a subcommittee within Linux Australia, which needs a treasurer and a secretary at a minimum, and we then have to report monthly back to Linux Australia, just to show how progress is going. So we’re kind of serving two masters at once—we’ve got WordCamp Central, and we’ve got Linux Australia. But that’s not a bad thing, because it’s double accountability. We’ve got the WordCamp Central team looking at budgets, and we’ve got Linux Australia looking at budgets as well. So, it’s a little more admin, but it’s double accountability, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />I think you mentioned the community. Does it also support the meetup groups as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Linux Australia offers grants. I was vice president of Linux Australia for a couple of years, and every year they offer grants. As of last year, they split it into software grants and community grants. So, if we do have local open-source meetups, WordPress meetups, they can help financially with venues, AV advice, and support. So, there’s huge support available to us through Linux Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds good. And is this an initiative from Linux Australia to nurture the open-source community in Australia, supporting them? So it’s not that everyone needs to compete to get support or get recognized—they’re like a welcoming umbrella for other open-source communities and supporting whatever programs those communities have. Do you know if a similar initiative takes place in other countries, for example with the Linux Foundation, or if there are similar activities elsewhere? Because this could actually be a good entry point for other WordPress communities where the Linux Foundation or association in the city or country is strong, but they’ve never connected. But perhaps either the WordPress community or someone else could reach out and start that collaboration. Do you know anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />I don’t know of any other countries where the Linux group supports WordPress directly, but if anyone’s listening and they’re interested, I’m happy to have a chat with them and maybe funnel things through Linux Australia, and see if we can get in contact with other countries or groups. But yeah, the system works really well for us—it’s not a burden having two teams for accountability. They’re really helpful, and the resources are fantastic. It just works really, really well for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well that sounds like a very good model to follow. If you have any resources you can share regarding this collaboration, I think that would be great to share in the Community Events channel or the Community Team’s channel, so that everyone else can look it up and see whether they can reach out to their own Linux Foundation or association in their country. Alright, anything that I missed about WordCamp Sydney that we have to talk about? I see this “Plan Your Pitch Online Workshop.” What is it? Is this a pre-event or a day-of-the-event workshop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />That was held a couple of weeks ago. We extended the speaker applications for a couple of weeks—not because we didn’t have enough, but just to give people the chance to submit more sessions. We also contacted more diverse communities. That workshop was given by a couple of the organizers, and it was basically an info session to show people how to create a pitch for a speaker application—not just for WordCamp, but for any conference—to give them confidence on what to put in a speaker pitch and how to put together a proposal to send off to a conference. For a first-time speaker, that can be quite daunting—you might not know what to put in a speaker application to push yourself forward and get noticed. So, the event showed people what a speaker proposal is, what things you need to include, what’s going to get you noticed, and how to apply. It was well attended, and we’ll probably wrap it up as a general webinar and put it out as a resource for people to reference. For example, if there’s another WordCamp next year, they can point to that resource or run it themselves if they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />So we’ll be able to see the recording later on the WordCamp Sydney website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yep, we’ll get it up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />This is super helpful. Thank you so much. I see that Daniel and Jo Minney hosted the event. Okay, wow. Alright, so is there anything else we missed? Anything else you want to share about WordCamp Sydney, things we should look forward to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Oh look, at the end of the day, it’s a big networking event. Yes, there’s the bonus that you get to hear some tracks and people talk, but the main point is just to get people back together, back to networking, back to being social. It’s one of the cheapest tech conferences in Australia—WordCamp itself. Sometimes people see the ticket price and think, “Oh, it’s just 70 bucks,” but the amount of value you get out of that is outstanding. As well as the two tracks over the two days, we’ve got morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea included, and there’s a social event on the Saturday evening as well for people to attend. So, extra networking brownie points for people who want to do that. It’s a huge conference with a lot of networking opportunities. I’d really encourage people to think about that. Even if some of the speaker sessions don’t quite align with what you do, come down just for the networking. The networking is the big thing—it’s the social aspect. I’m a freelancer, I work on my own. This is my office—my bedroom—so I spend 90% of my time in here. But it’s good to get out to local meetups and chat with other people. It’s good to get out to conferences and network with other people. It’s all about that social and network connection. Some of my best friends I met through meetup groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well I’m excited to meet you in person. We’ve been in touch since last year, since I think the BW reactivation in 2022, so that’s actually two years ago. And I look forward to Wapuus as well—you mentioned you still have a lot of Wapuus in Australia! So that’s something else I’m looking forward to, and meeting folks in Australia. Alright, I think it’s been a really great evening here, catching up with Wil and listening to what we can look forward to from WordCamp Sydney. There are still two months to go, but it’s the right time to start getting tickets, booking your hotel, booking your flight, and following all these social media accounts for WordCamp Sydney so that you don’t miss anything. It’s networking, right? The big thing for WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Networking is the big thing. So come and network your heart out. Looking forward to meeting everyone there. It’ll be good fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well, thank you so much, Wil. Good to see you online, and I’ll see you in two months in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />See you in person in two months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, alright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Thank you, Devin.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, <strong>Devin</strong> chats with <strong>Wil Brown</strong>, a seasoned WordCamp organizer, about the return of <strong>WordCamp Sydney </strong>after a five-year hiatus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil shares updates on the event&#8217;s organization, including the diverse team of organizers from across Australia, the challenges of planning in a post-COVID world, and the focus on rebuilding local WordPress communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also discuss what attendees can expect from the two-day event, covering everything from speaker sessions and networking opportunities to the importance of community-driven initiatives and sponsorships that make the event possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp Sydney&#8217;s Return After 5 Years</strong>: The last WordCamp in Australia took place in 2019, and WordCamp Sydney is making a long-awaited comeback, with excitement building across Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organizing a Large Event:</strong> Wil leads a diverse team of 12 organizers from all over Australia, and the event is expected to draw a large crowd. The team’s goal is not only to deliver a successful event but to train future organizers who can take WordCamps to their own cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus on Networking</strong>: Beyond the speaker tracks, the primary focus of WordCamp Sydney is on networking. Many attendees come specifically for the opportunity to connect with others in the WordPress and broader tech community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Two Days of Talks and Discussions</strong>: The event will have two tracks of talks, including a mix of technical and non-technical sessions. While workshops were considered, the team decided to focus on talks to streamline planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sponsorships and Financial Support</strong>: Wil highlighted the role of sponsors in making the event accessible, with 93.41% of the expected sponsorship already secured. They are also offering travel grants to support students and others who may need financial help to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Local Community Growth</strong>: Rebuilding local meetups post-COVID has been a priority, with efforts to encourage more local WordPress communities to form and grow. Wil emphasizes that smaller, informal meetups are just as valuable as larger events like WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration with Linux Australia</strong>: WordCamp Sydney benefits from a strong collaboration with Linux Australia, which provides financial and logistical support, including event insurance and grants for local open-source meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Encouraging First-Time Speakers</strong>: Wil and his team have hosted workshops to help first-time speakers craft and submit their talk proposals, fostering a more diverse speaker lineup and encouraging new voices in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/developerwil/\">Wil on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilbrownau/\">Wil on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Sydney 2024</a></strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/tickets/\">Get your ticket</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/sponsors/\">Sponsor</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/schedule/\">Schedule</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WooSesh 2024 Scheduled for October 29 and 30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161941\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-2024-scheduled-for-october-29-and-30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2795:\"<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\">WooSesh</a>, the virtual conference specifically designed for WooCommerce store builders, is scheduled for October 29-30, 2024, and promises an exciting experience.

Everyone is encouraged to submit a talk proposal, especially people groups who don&#8217;t feel well-represented at tech conferences.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Seshies Awards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights of WooSesh is the <a href=\"https://woosesh.com/seshies\">Seshies Awards</a>, which celebrate the talent and innovation within the WooCommerce community.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Folks, this week is WordCamp US, and over the past week or so, I spent a fair amount of time talking to people about that first-time experience. And as with any person who&#8217;s talking about their version of a shared experience, I started thinking back to mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my first experience of WordPress was not typical, though. I had never even heard of WordPress when I first went to a WordCamp. I think, I think most of the time people have heard of it before, but I was just there for the plot. So, like many people in my generation, all of us old people of the internet, I was first online with things like Angelfire and GeoCities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> When I went to college, I was keeping friends and family up to date on what I was up to with a little, like, newsletter? And then Xanga made it to our college campus, and eventually, so did Facebook. And I was one of those kids kind of like half-breaking sites with HTML and CSS I found online. I was changing layouts like every week to suit my mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when I graduated and found myself in a city with more talent and more competition than I&#8217;d actually accounted for, and started to realize that this online stuff I&#8217;d been doing for fun might actually be something that I needed to use as a tool professionally. So, I first went out and reserved my screen name everywhere I could think of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we&#8217;re talking, like, LiveJournal, WordPress.com, Blogger, all the things, and eventually wound up building my first site on Weebly. And it was super ugly. I&#8217;m not able to design things. I have an okay sense for a design that is good, but like, left to my own devices, it&#8217;s gonna be what that was, which is like a tie dye background for some reason, and had everything organized into little, like, blocks, I guess? You know, like, old magazine layouts? And it technically had everything that I wanted, but it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best version of any of those things either. I could write a little bit about myself and my services, I could add a few photos, there was a way to contact me, and I could do it all by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was a good place to start. Not long after that, though, I graduated into the need for a more professional-looking website, and it was beautiful. I received a website; someone built it for me. It was beautiful; it had this elegant design. Had a lot of custom functionality, but it was built using ColdFusion. I couldn&#8217;t do anything to it. I couldn&#8217;t change anything. All minor changes just had to kind of wait until there was enough to make sense to use that maintenance time, that maintenance retainer that I had. It really was just kind of formal. It was an isolated snapshot of all of the sorts of information that was required to be on the web at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then, later that year, I went to my first WordCamp, and I moved my site over to WordPress. And for the first time, I had that kind of mixture of professional expression that was on top of something that enabled my own expression. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t learn much more about the software for a few years. It was doing what I needed it to do, how I needed it to be done, and that&#8217;s really what mattered to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I skip a few years ahead after that, a few years later, when I was learning by organizing Meetups and WordCamps that had speakers that I wanted to hear from, that had topics that I felt like I needed to learn more about, what I remember most about that learning period for me is that I knew that I wasn&#8217;t the first person to run into any of my problems, which meant that a solution was probably already out there, and I could find someone to come and teach us about their solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, I knew that if we were running into a new problem and started breaking things left and right, there was always a way back. I was never really too far away from success. Like I felt like I might be lost, but I still was pretty much findable. And I guess I always want that for new users of the open web now, like new members of our WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want them to feel like the breaking of things is fine and safe and that no mistake is irretrievable. I want us to have some place where perfection isn&#8217;t the point. Now listen, I know the software is complex right now. The admin is a little mismatched, your first choices are huge choices, and there are a million places to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, all I can say is, start with what you need, and once you&#8217;ve got that, like the back of your hand, move on to what you need next. And keep doing that, bravely and messily, until what you&#8217;ve got is all you ever wanted. I&#8217;m gonna leave for you, in the show notes, a link to something called WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s gonna launch a little WordPress site in your browser. There will be no host. It&#8217;s just all in the browser itself. And it will have the latest bundled theme on it, Twenty Twenty-Four, and the latest version of WordPress. And that&#8217;s it. Go in there and click around on the left-hand menu. Start a post, change a page, modify the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just play around a while. See if it&#8217;s something that seems fun to you or valuable, or if it&#8217;s something that you can use as a time capsule for your kid because that sounds like a nice little mix of fun and work. And remember, sometimes perfection&#8217;s not the point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folks, as I mentioned at the top, WordCamp US is happening this week. It is September 17th through 20th this year, quite a few more days. But that also means that we&#8217;ll have quite a bit more stuff to do. If you have your tickets and haven&#8217;t looked at all of the presentations occurring over the four-day event, remember to take a look at the schedule and pick out topics that are interesting. And remember, just because you picked it out before you went doesn&#8217;t mean that if you get in there and it doesn&#8217;t work for you. You can&#8217;t choose a different topic while you&#8217;re there. And as a bonus, if this is your first WordCamp that you&#8217;ve ever attended, I have you covered. You can check out my previous episode on all the things to remember for your first time attending a WordCamp. And we have a pretty active community as well. If you just have questions or want to get in there and say, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m going to a vegan restaurant for lunch; who wants to join me?&#8217; You can do that, and you can definitely find somebody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there are some upcoming WordPress meetings. So, if you&#8217;re not attending WordCamp US but still want to connect with the community, there are a ton of team meetings that are happening. You can find those on make.WordPress.org/meetings, I think. So really, really easy URL to remember. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I also wanted to just call your attention to a few really big projects that still need a little bit of help around the project. So, on the one hand, we have Data Liberation. That is still a really big project, but specifically, we are nearly ready to start working on some user-facing elements of that. It is being powered by Playground, and because the data liberation, the migration of one site to another, is so complex, once we get those elements built into Playground, I think it also stands to fix a bunch of the problems that we have across our user flow, our user experience for the project. Things like having better theme previews and being able to get a sense for what a plugin functionally will do for you versus what it says it&#8217;s going to do for you. And getting a sense for what the admin looks like, all of those things. And so, anyone who wants to learn more about contributing to Playground or to Data Liberation, I absolutely encourage you to go check out those meetings, see what&#8217;s happening, and get your hands a bit dirty with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We also have a bunch of stuff happening in our community space. If you had received this podcast from somebody because they were like, hey, I know someone who might like WordPress or who has just learned WordPress and has never been to an event or any other reason that you are listening to this but don&#8217;t yet know the community, there is an easier option than just jumping straight into a WordCamp like I did. You can go to a meetup. You can see there&#8217;s a widget in your dashboard that&#8217;ll tell you what your nearest event is, but if you put your location into that widget, and nothing comes up. Technically, that means that you have an opportunity to bring a bunch of people together to teach you stuff you wish you knew about your site right now. So you can wander over into your dashboard and see those, or you can also head over to the community area on make.WordPress.org and anybody over there is happy to help you get started. And let me tell you, it is a very low-effort sort of thing to do. Here again, perfection&#8217;s not the point. And so that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there is a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. Or tomorrow if we&#8217;re all going to WordCamp US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:58] (Music outro)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"HeroPress: WordCamp Nairobi, Call For Speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=7402\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://heropress.com/wordcamp-nairobi-call-for-speakers/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-nairobi-call-for-speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3264:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/event-about-pg-banner-b-1024x501.webp\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"WordCamp Nairobu Banner\" /><p>I noticed recently that WordCamp Nairobi is on the calendar for 1-2 November.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Developer Hours, we will talk about Playground, and we will talk about Gutenberg 19.2, as well as some DataViews and design systems. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project, sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s again a special pleasure to have Maggie Cabrera with me. She&#8217;s a theme and core contributor and also sponsored by Automatic. And you work in the community also with the themes, or have been. You&#8217;re always a good supporter for theme developers, so welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you so much for taking the time today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: I&#8217;m good, thank you. Thanks for inviting me again. And yeah, I mainly work in core, but themes are very special for me, and very dear to my heart. So, whenever there&#8217;s an opportunity to help out with the community or anything, I&#8217;m there. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And I also see that there are quite a few themes coming from Automatic for the theme repository in all kinds of different shapes. So, I&#8217;m really happy that it inspires a lot of people to do very specific themes. Not this overall, everything looks the same block themes, but have some for WooCommerce, have some for a print, and have some for somebody who wants to do just public scripts, movie scripts, or something like that. It&#8217;s quite interesting what&#8217;s coming out like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. We&#8217;ve been working on submitting a lot of themes that the designers have been working throughout the year, and I&#8217;ve been impressed when reviewing them technically, the amount of talent that the designers have and how much they can actually express while working in the editor. And I see how both the designers and the editor have matured over the years, and it&#8217;s so lovely to see what you could do three years ago and what you can do now. It&#8217;s just so amazing, I just love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Can&#8217;t wait for the next 3, 4, 5 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah, and it&#8217;s also the speed with going from idea and the overall design, and then, all of a sudden, it&#8217;s a theme that you can publish on the WordPress repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. The designers don&#8217;t use Figma anymore, they just go jump on the site editor and they start the site editor, the edit in site editor, and then, with Playground, they generate a PR that we review for the technical stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Uh-huh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So, the themes make it through the theme directory guidelines, because there&#8217;s like, you need to add the license for the images and the assets and all that stuff. But, in general, most of the work is done in the editor and there&#8217;s barely any code that needs to be touched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, it&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s amazing to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. And Beatriz Fialho, she demonstrated that in a recent Hallway Hangout, how that connection works between the Create Block Theme plugin and then the Playground and then the GitHub PRs. Yeah, so, how these three tools actually work together, and that&#8217;s quite interesting, too, how streamlined the process is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: And it&#8217;s only getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, getting better and better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so, we have a few announcements, dear listeners, and well, I have a section here that says listener questions and we haven&#8217;t gotten any listener questions lately. So, if you have a question, just send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com\">Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com</a> or ping me on the WordPress Slack or on Twitter if you have a question that you want the answer to, and we can answer them here at the podcast here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Hours<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, today I have a few announcements. The Developer Hours, a first look at a new API that will come with WordPress 6.7, and that is the Template Registration API for plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, plugins had a really hard time getting templates into the block theme, the site editor, so they can be offered to the site owner or designers to use whatever comes in the plugin, also for the front end. And there was a developer ask last week about that and also a Developer Blog article about how to do this in various detail. Mind you, WordPress 6.7 hasn&#8217;t been out yet, but it was in Gutenberg 19.1, so that was the Developer Hours last week, or this week? This week, sorry, September 10th. Today is September 12th. I haven&#8217;t followed that example in the Developer Blog post yet completely, but I can see how that really makes it a difference when you, for instance, have a plugin with a custom post type as well as custom fields. You can also provide all that already in a template, both for the single post of your custom post type, as well as for the archive template. So, your plugin is pretty much ready to be used with any block theme, or also for classic themes, of course, if you want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the next Developer Hour is on September 24th and, as always, on 1500 UTC, that&#8217;s 11:00 AM Eastern. It&#8217;s about the introduction to DataViews. And it&#8217;s not so much the introduction in what&#8217;s in the site editor now, but it&#8217;s more like how you can use the DataViews component as part of your own plugin for the settings page, or when you handle other data that&#8217;s coming in from a different source like from an API, say, on the internet. So, the Developer Hours will cover the fundamentals of DataViews component, how to add a React app to the WordPress admin page, and how to display a custom datasets using the DataView component. And, there will be a Q&amp;A session, and there&#8217;s also already a post on the Developer Blog for the first part of it, like using DataViews to display and interact with data and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s September 24th, 1500 UTC. And I&#8217;ll share, of course, all the links in the show notes, not only the RSVP for the Developer Hour, but also the article for the Developer Blog. And I will also share the subscribe to the Developer Blog links, so we&#8217;ll never miss a post again. And also, I will share the link to the Developer Hours YouTube playlist, so you can go back and say, &#8220;Oh, which Developer Hours have I missed?&#8221; or, &#8220;Oh, there was a Developer Hour, I need to learn this.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s actually pretty cool to have those resources all available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Developer Blog, there&#8217;s the newest &#8220;What&#8217;s New For Developers&#8221; roundup post available since September 10th, and it has about 25 different changes for plugin developers as well as themes. Some of them about 6.6.2, other ones are coming from Gutenberg 19.0 or Gutenberg release 19.1 and they&#8217;re divided up between plugin and tools or theme developers. Some things are also good for both, but you&#8217;ll figure that out. But it&#8217;s just a rundown of developer relevant things that coming into WordPress before WordPress 6.7 comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was a whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you Maggie for being so patient. Any comments about things you want to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I was just looking at the What&#8217;s New For Developers and I think those are so useful to keep up with all the changes in Gutenberg and core because so much happens in so little time and it&#8217;s kind of hard to follow everything and be able to know what you can benefit from in your themes or in your plugins or whatever implementations that you&#8217;re making. So, yeah, it&#8217;s so good to have that all condensed and easy to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you. Yeah. Yeah, there&#8217;s a whole group of writers on the Developer Blog that are working on it and we are scouting all the things that come out of the teams being the releases or comments to core, but even then, we miss things. So, if you find something that we missed, don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll just add it to it or bring it into the next one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roundup post comes out always on the 10th of the month, so October 10th is the next one that will come out, and I think the designated writer, we are working on a team on this, but the designated writer will be Nick Diego, and he&#8217;s leaving right now for WordCamp US. But, yeah, he will be back and then start writing, but we are all contributing to that. We have a whole list of things where we just copy paste things from release or from track tickets and then we need to do some research and then have the little blurb there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roadmap 6.7<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well, speaking of 6.7, the roadmap 6.7 has been out and Anne has published it on September 3rd. That was pretty much a few days after Jessica Lyshek and I were wondering if there will be a roadmap post at all before Beta One, but there is, so we are going through it fast because it&#8217;s a long post anyway, so we might as go fast, but we also will cover it in the next episode after the next one. So, this is 107. We will cover it in 109 when we&#8217;re going to record it around October 10th, that&#8217;s when Beta Two was out for 6.7. Beta One is October 1st and then, October 8th will be Beta Two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the roadmap, the first thing that comes up is of course the new default theme. Have you looked at it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What they&#8217;re working on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I&#8217;ve not been following it as much as I would&#8217;ve liked because I&#8217;ve been busy, but been looking at the design and a little bit at the repo and I am, as always, very impressed with the design work and how ambitious this thing looks like, even though I think Twenty Twenty Four was really ambitious, I think this one&#8217;s outdoing it because look at the amount of patterns there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There&#8217;s so many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I know for a fact how hard they are to build in such a short period of time to the standards that we expect the default team to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s a great work being done there. So, for sure, if anyone&#8217;s listening is interested in theming, go and have a look at the repo and check the work being done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, how many patterns are there? I can&#8217;t even count them. Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s really a lot. Yeah, so we probably need to do a review of all the patterns at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh yeah. I&#8217;m looking at the repo and I&#8217;m scrolling through all the ones that are mentioned. It&#8217;s long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and I like the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think it&#8217;s at least double what Twenty Twenty Four has, or close to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Oh yeah, at least. Yeah. What I see is also the name of the patterns are quite revealing, so you know pretty much what&#8217;s going to be in there, but I like the vertical header. We haven&#8217;t talked about vertical headers yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And so, really, really excited about about trying that out, and then, it has a poster section and I can read a few patterns for a photo blog and then portfolio and newsletter, sign up. That&#8217;s kind of standard, so I&#8217;m tempted to install it and make it&#8230; Put it up on one of my technical blogs and try it out and see what&#8217;s coming out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: If you give it a couple weeks, you will have an odd version that&#8217;s decent enough to start doing your thing because it doesn&#8217;t have any functionality in it. What you will be missing, it&#8217;s probably going to be minor stuff like translation on patterns and, yeah, maybe you will be missing some accessibility fixes and stuff like that, but you will have most of the design on that version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent, excellent. Yeah, so, well it&#8217;s going to be two weeks until I actually get to do some of that. Yeah. And then, what&#8217;s also going to be in 6.7 is definitely a refinement of the DataViews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And some of them is the extensibility that you can extend or register and unregister some of the actions that are in there via plugins. I know that that&#8217;s already in there, because it was in Gutenberg and that&#8217;s going to be in 6.7 as well. Yeah, the grid layout in the DataViews to follow the aspect ratios and there are quite a few interesting developments there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is something that is definitely exciting, that&#8217;s the polishing of the query loop where there are additional features in there, like the offsets and all that. Putting it from the toolbar into the sidebar and all that. So, that is always good because some of the features actually confuse me and other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> And if they confuse us who are quite used to interacting with it often enough, I can&#8217;t imagine for someone that encountered it for the first time. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like that too, yeah. We have been talking about this podcast about some of the Zoom Out experience and that the team has been working on it. We will see if it makes it at whole or just in parts, and it&#8217;s an experience where, when you select a pattern, for instance, that your canvas zooms out and shows you more of your page than the normal editor would show you so you can add the pattern easily and see it in relation to other things. I think that&#8217;s a great feature. I just don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s defined, that there are sections and what if I want to edit, then I have a different mode. And so, it&#8217;s all a little bit, yeah, we need to figure that out, and as long as I&#8217;m confused&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I understand. We&#8217;re working on that and Zoom Out is already in core, it&#8217;s just that the way to access it is not as straightforward as anyone would think. Every time you go on global styles, you will trigger Zoom Out when you&#8217;re browsing the style book, I think it is. But the mode is there. The code is, it&#8217;s just, the thing is, how are we going to surface this to the users? That&#8217;s most of the main thing that we&#8217;re discussing is, how do we want the users to experience Zoom Out? So, depending on where we are when we&#8217;re closer to the release, we&#8217;ll figure out if it stays somewhat hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, right now, I think there&#8217;s a button that you can click in the preview. We&#8217;re iterating on that. I think, right now, it&#8217;s on the preview, but I think that&#8217;s going to move. It&#8217;s no longer in the patterns. I think we&#8217;ve moved out of that because we thought that you might want to not have it trigger if you have a theme that has patterns that are not full sections and you want to insert patterns inside patterns, which wasn&#8217;t really working with the Zoom Out view, but still, we also want to&#8230; We&#8217;re working on, there&#8217;s an open issue that we&#8217;re still iterating on and I think it&#8217;s going to move into an experiment, to add Zoom Out when you are creating a new page so that, instead of having this pop-up that shows you&#8230; Like, Twenty Twenty Four has four or five versions of a page. Instead of having that pop-up every time, you would actual go into pattern insertion mode and you would just build your page using the pattern. So, you have, or you can toggle that out and just write a new page with just text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, we&#8217;re still&#8230; The mode is there and still needs polishing and all that, but mainly what we&#8217;re iterating is what we want the user experience to be. So, we cannot really predict what exactly is going to land, but some of it will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there&#8217;s some great testing going around and if you want to test that out, I&#8217;m sure we can just install the Gutenberg plugin 19.2 and then play around with it and see what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t. And, if you pay attention, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to narrow down why you all feel trapped or confused or something like that, but it&#8217;s hard to describe that. But if you can, that would be really helpful for the designers and the developers to figure out where&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, feedback is more than welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Absolutely, yeah, and if someone has an idea in mind as to how they would think they could benefit from this. They are a plugin author and they think they could use this for something, idea that they have, then that&#8217;s more than welcome, too, because we think we know the blows people will want to go through, but we are probably not thinking what everyone else has in mind. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I understand. So, the 6.7 also will come with some media improvements. We talked about the HEIC images that are automatically converted to JPEGs. Then, auto size of lazy loading and some background attachments or fixed backgrounds that are on the block level as well, and, of course, need to be uploaded in the media library and all that kind of thing. Yeah, and then, the meta boxes in the iFrame post editor. There is a PR and Anne has shared the links to that, how meta box is going to be, because we talked about it here a bit that the post editor and the side editor become one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But it&#8217;s a little bit tricky when the post editor has meta boxes on the bottom, then, it loads it not in the iFrame. The iFrame is the unified canvas or editor, but if it&#8217;s not in the iFrame, then some of the things are not working like they are in the editor. So, the interfaces are, all of a sudden, don&#8217;t match. So, they&#8217;re kind of trying to figure out that, and I think they found a good solution with two sections in the editor and the post editor where the block editor is on top, and underneath, they have an additional window there. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see, but I think with the block bindings UI that&#8217;s coming in 19.2, some of it is offset because those are a better interface to connect with post meta data or other custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, what else is the design tools? Everybody&#8230; No, not everybody. Every block gets border controls now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, you can&#8230; Yeah, we ran through the list here quite often and those are all coming to the WordPress 6.7 and it also stabilizes some of the block supports because some of them, they were still in experimental status, especially topography supports features, and they will come out of experimental status, so more people can use them now in their own custom blocks or for block variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about template registration API, that&#8217;s coming, and then, we will talk about the preview options and then updates to the interactivity API and the block bindings API. And another one is the HTML API. So, it&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s definitely, again, with the last three of them, developer heavy, but there are great improvements for the interfaces and for the contact creators and the designers in the site editor. So, that is going to be WordPress 6.7 and we are going to dive into it in episode 109. That&#8217;s two episodes from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, back to our program here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> First, what&#8217;s released? It was WordPress 6.6.2, and it had 26 fixes, 15 in core or in track, identified in track and 11 identified in the Gutenberg repo for the block editor, and some maintenance security release. But some of the fixes are bug fixes for things that were in 6.6 and dealt with the lower CSS specificity. That changed a few sites that looked a little bit different, and now, the bug fixes are in. There were quite a few in 6.6.1, and now 6.6.2, has caught up with the other ones. And then, there&#8217;s a bug fix for the derivative state in the interactivity API and, yeah, some are for the post editor rendering in the iFrame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release post has the whole list of things that&#8217;s in there and what&#8217;s new for developers. I&#8217;ve written a few sentences about the bug fixes that are relevant for our theme developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That gets us to Gutenberg 19.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>193 PRs, 58 bug fixes, and 59 enhancements. 54 contributors contributed to them. Six of them are first-time contributors, so it&#8217;s always good to have first time contributors. I am so happy…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, it&#8217;s&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; they are identified and in the release post so you can scroll down and learn more about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yep. So, do you want to lead us for the first one?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Move bulk actions menu to the filter and consolidate with floating tool and total items display?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s part of the database, and it is&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think the biggest problem with the data views is that they want that on that real estate on the screen&#8230; Do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And now, it&#8217;s all very top-lastic and now I need to give it a little bit more space, so they moved the bulk actions to the footer, and it&#8217;s really interesting to see how that comes about when you do it in incremental, and somebody should do a video, how it&#8217;s going to work from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The first few to the next one, that&#8217;s probably going to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>I think, in general, there&#8217;s also this constant concern in the editor in general. You want to give the users as many options as they can while keeping things simple. And then, do you want to hide things that are not something that you use all the time, but still users need to know they are there when they need them. So, it&#8217;s a constant&#8230; It&#8217;s a balancing act, to not overcrowd the UI while still giving the users a really powerful tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Definitely. And, with the admin pages, it comes that there&#8217;s a 20-year history, what these listings on the admin pages can do, so that needs…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> You need to be able to do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, and extend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>&#8230; I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to be in mind for 6.8 or 6.9, that, once the DataView component is&#8230; But it&#8217;s also one single component that&#8217;s really hard to do. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for people to start trying and adopting it early so they can influence the development early on, because, yeah, it needs to be very extendable. So, the best way to do it properly is giving feedback so that the core contributors actually have in mind the needs of plugin developers. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so, there is composite component that comes in, too, that had a few PRs in 19.2, but the bigger PR is going to be merged in 19.3 and it will come out in two weeks. So, you will find some of the references interesting because they say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t use the composite AI.&#8221; So, what is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there&#8217;s a new version. Sometimes, a component has run its course and needs to be refactored and one of those is the drop-down menu version 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been looking at that. It looks so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Sometimes you really need to learn from things, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I also have the feeling, especially in software development, when you do go new routes, that the first time you never get it really right, because it teaches you how it wants to be done, whatever you&#8217;re going to do. And then, the second time, you get it right and you learn from that and then you iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> You&#8217;re always iterating, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, you cannot settle with the first version of the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Correct. Yeah. I will share a link to the drop-down menu version 2 tracking issue on Gutenberg, so you see what&#8217;s all in the works and where the vision goes. And I will also share the Storybook. It&#8217;s not Storyboard, it&#8217;s Storybook, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Storybook, yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s Storybook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Storybook, yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m always getting Stylebook, Storyboard, Storybook…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; totally confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Actually, it&#8217;s Storyboard, you are right, it is Storyboard. I&#8217;m thinking of Storybook because it&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, so it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Is it confusing now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Well, you provide a link so people will know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No matter what, just click on the link and then you get there, and I really have been discovering the storyboard. It&#8217;s been a while since I discovered it, but it was a component work. It&#8217;s so good to go there instead of reading the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh, yeah, I do it all&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; in the block editor handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I use it all the time. All the time. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, why do you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Well, when we&#8217;re developing and we need to touch a component or there&#8217;s a component that I&#8217;ve never worked with, sometimes, I just don&#8217;t even know what attributes are available to me and it&#8217;s so much easier to just checking the Storybook because it&#8217;s just more visual than actually going into the remi and all that stuff. I will eventually do that too, but it feels easier for me to&#8230; I&#8217;m more of a visual person, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And me, too. Yeah, and seeing things in action and you can put in values in certain things and then see how the component behaves as a standalone component. You don&#8217;t see it acting in context and that&#8217;s sometimes really good because you can isolate how your interface is going to be. So, yeah, I really like that. Yeah, so, I&#8217;m going to share that in the show notes so you can look at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The next one is the block bindings UI. So, there is a pull request to only allow admin for now, admin users to create and modify bindings by default. There is a discussion going on the track ticket to get it into core about, is it really necessary to go for the admin role or shouldn&#8217;t we go for capabilities? And when capabilities, which one is it? Is it just edit post or is it edit meta or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s quite an interesting discussion because, all of a sudden, you get a bigger picture of what all needs to be happening to make this a good feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. And it feels like, if you&#8217;re trying to match what Carl was doing, the classic editor, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really work. So, you have to rethink it in the context of the site editor these days. What do the users today need now, not what was implemented 10 years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Right, totally. And the other good news is, about the block bindings UI, it&#8217;s coming out of experiments. So, if you install the Gutenberg plugin, you will be able to see it right away. You don&#8217;t have to enable an experiment for that now and can interact and try it out and test it before it comes into 6.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives you a way to see all the block bindings for a block or for a section, and which fields are attributed. What it does not do yet is register the custom fields. You still need a developer to do that. That is not yet in the editor, and that&#8217;s the missing piece where I say, okay, block binding is all nice, but I still need to have a different plugin to register my custom post types&#8230; Yeah, custom post types, and with that, also the custom fields, but it&#8217;s one step at a time. Yeah. That&#8217;s the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Rome wasn&#8217;t built in one day either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So there was something in the site editor that has been removed now. That&#8217;s the shuffle button from the block toolbar that we want…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That button was added&#8230; Well, I might be wrong here. I think we want the shuffle button to be available mainly when we are on Zoom Out mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because you don&#8217;t want the users to be shuffling by mistake a block, a pattern that they have already changed because they&#8217;re just editing their site. But when they&#8217;re still composing the template, they still have not decided if the pattern that they have inserted is the one that they want. We still want them to have the ability to shuffle through other patterns in the same category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s a quick browse through the patterns that we have per category. So, now it&#8217;s also to be limited to a category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, you want to see which one of the call to action patterns are fitting nicely to that, so you don&#8217;t have to click and edit. You can just shuffle it and see how it flows. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting how a confusion can happen when you&#8217;re actually editing, editing things. So, yeah, and that&#8217;s something to learn only from usage here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is&#8230; It&#8217;s a tiny change, however, you probably are going to look for it when you want to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; extend your media from the cover block. It moved from the inspector controls or from the sidebar to the block toolbar into the block setting and in the&#8230; Yeah, so, you can do it from the block toolbar. You can clear the media and you don&#8217;t have to open up the sidebar and go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But if you are accustomed to having it in a sidebar and clicking there, you can now say, &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; It&#8217;s in the toolbar. Yeah, sometimes, those changes kind of can frustrate-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s aligning it with other blocks, like the site logo, the feature image. They have it on the same place where it now is for the code blocks. So, now, it&#8217;s more consistent with all the blocks that behave the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah, good point. Yeah. And we love consistency, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yes. Yeah, because with having so many contributors, it&#8217;s very easy to not think about those tiny things. So, it&#8217;s really nice when someone picks one up and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this doesn&#8217;t feel right,&#8221; and then you notice that it&#8217;s inconsistent with other blocks and then you just bring them all in line. It&#8217;s very satisfying, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah. And it actually removes confusion, and I think it&#8217;s a good time to do that now in that place where the editor is, to go through the design. And I know that we&#8217;re going to talk about it in our, later on after we get through the change here, about the design system and what&#8217;s going to happen there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next one, maybe you can help me out with that. The content only is&#8230; So, it says, &#8220;Content only, add support for block styles on top level content only lock blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I think&#8230; I&#8217;m not so sure about the top level part. I think it means, when you have a pattern that is content-only and it has a group lock that is surrounding it, sometimes you will have block style variations that affect a group on whatever is inside. So, we&#8217;re enabling those style variations in content only. So, you can still change the styles in Cascade because the block styles in your JSON file will affect the group log and whatever&#8217;s inside. I want my group block to this background, but I want all the paragraphs inside this group block to have this other color. And you will not be able on content only to change the color of the paragraph, but because you will be able to change the block style, that Cascade still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. Yeah. Now I get it. Yeah. Excellent. Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Wonderful. And then, we have two things that are already also on the Zoom Out mode. There&#8217;s an edit button on the Zoom Out mode toolbar, meaning that you can switch to an edit. Zoom Out means you&#8217;re just looking, yeah, but then, you also want&#8230; If you see something and then you want to edit it, then you need the edit button. Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that&#8217;s how…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think both of those PRs are adding two different ways to exit Zoom Out mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because we&#8217;re still thinking about how you enter it and how you leave it. So, that&#8217;s it. If you feel like you want more granular control over the blocks inside the sections, like we were talking about, content only is very similar, then you would want to be able to exit. So, these are two ways, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the second one is, you double click on a block and then you exit Zoom Out mode and hopefully that block is then selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And so, that&#8217;s a good thing. And then, so, the Zoom Out mode is definitely something to explore quite a bit because it changes how you might think about site building and the order of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next two items are part of the design tool block border, block support everywhere. Now, comment edit link and the comment reply link also get border support. So we have it everywhere now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There might still be a few missing. I&#8217;m going to take a look for 6.7 on all the design tools because I have&#8230; For 6.6, I did the roster of the design tools and there were some empty spaces in there. Now, I&#8217;m going to fill up those empty spaces on the border controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next one is the post publish upload media dialogue is now also handling the upload errors. So, the post publish upload media dialogue, that&#8217;s the dialogue that comes when you hit publish once, and then you get a suggestion that you have images that are referencing a third outside your site. So, might be Google or might be a different website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It could also be the theme. It could also be the theme, because the theme adds&#8230; On the templates, it adds the URL and it points to your asset folder on the themes, but the images are not on your uploads folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: And that&#8217;s the difference. So, those are lost if you change themes, but if you click that button, those get moved into your uploads folder. So, it&#8217;s in your media and your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, I didn&#8217;t know about that, but that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah. I think that&#8217;s the reason why this is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, actually, I had early on with Ella, a dialogue that images coming from Google should automatically be uploaded. Yeah, yeah, and there were no block themes around when we had that discussion, so that was, what, five years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, yeah. For sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And it started out with a button on the toolbar of the image block where you can say upload image to media library. But then, it was also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; &#8220;Okay, if I had 15 in my post, yeah, I don&#8217;t want to do it one at a time. Give me a feature where I can do 10 at a time.&#8221; And that was in the publishing section where it says, &#8220;Hold, you have images that are pointing someplace else,&#8221; but you were able to click on them, but the errors wouldn&#8217;t bubble up. Yeah, so, and that has now been solved with this one. So, now you get the error messages when it doesn&#8217;t work. Before it just didn&#8217;t do anything. Yeah? You were clicking and clicking and you didn&#8217;t know why it wouldn&#8217;t work. So, the typography changes comment is that, now, you can individually override the presets through the interface, I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I think it&#8217;s theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, it was theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I think it is. There&#8217;s an example on the PR. You click, &#8220;Here is some test.&#8221; Theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There is a little arrow and you see how you can set fluid to through on a specific-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> &#8230; for the whole site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Per the preset for fluid. Yes. Yeah. So, you can have a preset one that is fluid and the other one is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> The global setting can be set to false, and that can be overridden by one specific concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. Well, thank you for making that clear. And the next one is, there is now an experiment for client-side media processing in Gutenberg. That is by Pascal Birchler. He actually has his own plugin where he experiments with all kinds of different media processing, and this one is coming as an experiment to Gutenberg. So, I&#8217;m really looking forward to that. It&#8217;s for client side media processing, so you don&#8217;t need the server involved in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s all in a browser. It&#8217;s all in the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s all in the browser. And then, the last one from the enhancements is the details block gets now a transform from any block type. From a paragraph, you can make a details block. You can&#8230; From a list block, you can make a details block. And so, it&#8217;s really cool. It&#8217;s a small quality of life change that changes a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New API<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, we come to the extensibility section and there is a new API for the preview options. So, there is, on the right-hand side, on the top, you have the preview and to do either mobile or desktop or preview in a new tab. That&#8217;s what’s there, and I think now, with this release or with this Gutenberg release or the one prior, there&#8217;s also the 50% one that is your zoomed out one, right, for the desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That might go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, it might go away. It&#8217;s a zoomed out, might go away thing. Yeah. But, right now, it&#8217;s they have with the menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I mean, it might go away because it will be moved somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Not because it will go away fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It won&#8217;t totally go away, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; it might be its own button. Yeah. But what this PR enables is that plugin developers can have separate preview options and register them with the Gutenberg so people can look at things in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, one of the examples is that if you build your new newsletter with the block editor, you don&#8217;t want the preview to look how it&#8217;s on the website, but you want to how to look in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; that&#8217;s where this example is for. But there are other examples that I right now can&#8217;t come up with, but because that&#8217;s my lack of imagination right now. But if I think about it some more, I&#8217;ll find some that were&#8230; If you have an idea, what else could be in the preview?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I don&#8217;t know, maybe you could do a preview of dark mode, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yeah. Or a preview of the screen for your TV because it&#8217;s a special site…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; that it&#8217;s only for the TV, but you want to see it because it&#8217;s a whole different…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Or a tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; aspect ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Maybe you want the landscape tablet from your preview…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>&#8230; because your website is going to be used by&#8230; Yeah, it could be anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, I think we have a little conversation here. We come up with a lot of examples, and plugin developers, these are your opportunities. I&#8217;m going through the other 100 ones, red line items, and I stopped by CSS and styling. And these are the two PRs that made it into 6.6.2 as bug fixes. One was the featured image block, getting the CSS specificity reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And now is behaving nicely again with the sites. And then, the other one was the retain same specificity for non iFrame selectors. That was the piece that, if the editor wasn&#8217;t loaded into the iFrame…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, I see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; some of the theme JSON things, spacing rules were overwritten by the editor. So, you wouldn&#8217;t have the same look from the editor like you have on the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front page wasn&#8217;t affected by that, but it was just the editor thing. Yeah. We are also accustomed that the front page looks like the editor or the editor looks like the front page, that we notice those changes and are, &#8220;Do we have to fix something?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I must say that the work that&#8217;s been done with the CSS specificity has been amazing. I think it&#8217;s a really, really hard change that landed on 6.6 that, of course, add some consequences that are now being patched, but it&#8217;s still, I see the work being done to not break people&#8217;s sites and fix them when, inevitably, sometimes we do. And it&#8217;s a very big change that it&#8217;s very useful and the people really need it, but it&#8217;s still complicated and complex and they&#8217;ve been painstakingly making sure we&#8217;re not really breaking people&#8217;s site, even if it&#8217;s just by patching 6.6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the unification of CSS specificity was very important to make the style variations work, the extended block style variations, and to have a standard way of doing things. Yeah, well…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; what you said before, yeah, there were so many contributors and now, eight years of development, some people have different CSS or early blocks had a different CSS behavior than later blocks and, yeah, everybody learned from things and now we&#8217;re back and fixing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, and that&#8217;s more consistent for themers. They know what to expect from core blocks. Other CSS is going to behave. They know that it&#8217;s going to be consistent. So, yeah, in the long run, it&#8217;s going to be great, even though now it&#8217;s a little bit of a bumpy road. But yeah, keep reporting the bugs so we can fix them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, definitely. So, on that, we are pretty much almost through the changelog for the 19.2. One thing is that, if you are a plugin developer or developer who wants to explore the DataViews component, the documentation has been updated quite a bit and edit stories for combined fields and layout properties, and that also, you can explore all that for the data use component that is in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, anything else that you&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I think we covered a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, we covered a lot. Yeah, yeah. But we are now arrived at the section, what&#8217;s in active development or what&#8217;s discussed? And I wanted to point out to a design blog post, not that because it was mine, but because it was very important to have it and a DataViews series on the design blog about what are the features that coming that the design team is working on? And there&#8217;s just an update number one, and there will be many, many to come on the Design Team Blog. That&#8217;s make.wordpress.org/design. More and more posts will come out and it also is an iteration of the design shares, and Joen Asmussen does every two weeks putting the whole work of the design team on display and what are they working on with the GitHub or track tickets where the discussion is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design Systems<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And, speaking of Joen, he just published a very visionary post about advancing the WordPress design system, and that covers that with all the new development, and in the editor, there&#8217;s also coming&#8230; What they also built is actually a design system with the components that can be used by plugin developers as well as the site editor or Gutenberg, as well as outside of the WordPress system. So, it&#8217;s the design system out of the atomic blocks building coming from components and then sub-components and building larger components. And then, you can build the interfaces from that. And everything is also done in the Figma repository that is open and public for WordPress. And then, the Storybook that we mentioned before. So, these are the three pillars of the WordPress design system. And, if you haven&#8217;t noticed that, reading that particular article will help and bring it all together and contributors will work on it, but this is where the framework of the design system to bring it all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is actually what we talked about as well is to focus on the specific updates on the Figma libraries and the Storybook site to set clear and actionable goals for the design system and also go through the current system and look for inconsistencies so they can be fixed. And then, also to elevate and connect the three pieces to a unified system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be bi-weekly updates on the progress in Figma. You can have your comments on the draft. And, of course, in GitHub that&#8217;s a known place where you can leave your comments and your work if you wanted to. So, a good example of a Storybook design system references the design system from the auto manufacturer, Audi, how they deal with that for the website development. What&#8217;s your thoughts about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I just love these kinds of posts. I love all the design work on it. I love the attention to detail. I love the consistency of that. I think it&#8217;s fantastic. If you go into the Figma file that Joen links, you see that attention to detail. You see all of those components. That&#8217;s how we keep everything consistent, when you&#8217;re implementing something new and you&#8217;re using a component and something like, this is not looking good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we were seeing on the PR that we talked about where we&#8217;re adding the extensibility on the preview dropdown. If you&#8217;re looking at that PR, there&#8217;s comments saying, &#8220;Oh, it looks like, when you&#8217;re adding a new item, there&#8217;s a left padding or left margin that it&#8217;s in misalign with the rest of the things.&#8221; And you start picking those up and seeing, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this back here.&#8221; And again, you go back and keep things consistent. So, it becomes easier and easier for new developers to come use a component and just basically use them out of the box and everything looks exactly right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think that&#8217;s pretty important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It also speeds up development because there are…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; certain discussions or decisions that were already made and you just need to pick them up and move with your idea forward, but you don&#8217;t have to build any&#8230; I mean, you still have to use them and know how to use them, but you don&#8217;t have to think about interfaces anymore, you&#8217;re just going to need to know-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>That&#8217;s already thought of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There&#8217;s so much work in these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: That&#8217;s actually a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie Cabrera: There is so much discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>It&#8217;s a big point of this as well. It&#8217;s kind of that. So, we have the three pillars, that&#8217;s the components, the Figma library, and the Storybook, but it&#8217;s also design, development, and accessibility that brings it all together. There are a few words in that article that I think I don&#8217;t understand. I need to talk with Joen about it, but when he uses the word &#8220;Pattern,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think he thinks WordPress patterns. It&#8217;s more design patterns. That&#8217;s a different pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and he talks about design tokens. I don&#8217;t know exactly what that means. Yeah, so, it&#8217;s a little bit heavy on the technical terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, the design lingo. Yeah, I cannot help you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>You&#8217;re a developer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah. No, it&#8217;s not just that. I really enjoy working closely with design on designers. I think it&#8217;s one of my favorite things. I think there&#8217;s also a bit of the foreign language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie Cabrera: I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s for you, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>I think there&#8217;s a little bit of that because when language gets a little bit more, I don&#8217;t know, more technical or more specific…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> &#8230; if you&#8217;re not fully into that, we&#8217;re used to it as in the developer lingo, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because we do know what the difference is between, I don&#8217;t know, yeah. But, for designers, it&#8217;s even harder, and if you are not speaking the language, then it&#8217;s an extra…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> An extra hard skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It has some things in there, like, what is a sticker sheet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think we can clear that all up by asking, commenting on the post and figure that out. Yeah. So&#8230; But it&#8217;s a very interesting post. I learned a lot from it, and it also seems to have quite a few comments there that are worth reading. So, I will share a link to it in the show notes and also the link to the DataViews update that just has a visual representation of a new feature that comes to the DataViews. So, it&#8217;s all in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that was it. So, Maggie, if somebody wanted to get a hold of you, where would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah, I&#8217;m on Slack. My Slack, I&#8217;m&#8230; Let me check, because I&#8217;m not sure what my username is. I think I&#8217;m OneMaggie. Yeah, OneMaggie, and on Twitter, it&#8217;s One_Maggie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Okay, and I&#8217;ll share those links also in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is it.

It&#8217;s such a brave new world. I had excellent results in making some of my work easier by using an AI tool:  a draft outline of a presentation in a second language (<a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a>) , getting a tailored list of sightseeing activities in a new city (<a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a>) , or  correcting code examples to WordPress Coding Standards (<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">ChatGPT</a>), are only three examples of well executed AI assistance. I also took a glimpse at <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/aistudio\">Google&#8217;s AI Studio</a>, that allows you to build apps or integrations that tap into Google Gemini AI. All very fascinating, I found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My latest go-to AI tool replaces Google search for me. Google gives me short snippets and the links, I still have to weed through and spend some time finding the right information.  <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> provides the answer with details and sources. No further trip around the Internet necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your day-to-day experience with AI? What did you test lately?  Please let me know in the comments or hit reply on the email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now back to regular programming&#8230;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a lovely weekend, and if you are traveling to Portland, Oregon, have a safe trip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</a><ol><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#upcoming-events\">Upcoming Events</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordpress-6-6-2\">WordPress 6.6.2</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#gutenberg-19-2\">Gutenberg 19.2 </a></li></ol></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordcamp-us-showcase-talks\">WordCamp US Showcase talks</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#0-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">Building Blocks and tools for the Block Editor</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordpress-playground\">WordPress Playground</a></li></ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\"><strong>State of the Word</strong></a> will take place on December 16, 2024, at 09:00 UTC and will be live-streamed from Tokyo, Japan.

In his post for GoDaddy Pro, <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/resources/skills/a-primer-on-wordpress-block-markup-for-the-non-programmer\"><strong>A primer on WordPress block markup for the non-programmer</strong></a>, he wrote: &#8220;Understanding the fundamentals of any WordPress block is not as difficult as mastering PHP as you would have back in the pre-Gutenberg era.&#8221; Following along you&#8217;ll learn about the various concepts of the modern WordPress theme, template and patterns, and of course, blocks. Then he continues to give you a glimpse under the hood and shows you some block markup code and teaches you what attributes are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels similar to when my dad showed me how to exchange spark plugs on my car or start my car with a jumper cables or replace a tire. I never aimed to be a car mechanic, but having a bit of knowledge can save you when you get stranded in a foreign place with no cell phone reception. Although you are not a programmer, knowing a bit about the underlying code base, can go a long way. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kathryn Presner</strong> and <strong>Helena Artmann</strong> recorded their online workshop on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/09/12/exploring-the-query-loop-block/\"><strong>Exploring the Query Loop block</strong></a>. &#8220;The Query Loop block might sound bland, but it’s actually the driving force behind the layout of modern WordPress blogs. Dive into this critical block together with Presner and explore ways to show off your content and learn how to configure it to get the result you want. They also cover the different types of blocks you might want to nest inside it. Finally, you uncover some lesser-known ways to use the Query Loop block, to display pages and other types of content besides posts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike McAlister</strong> from Ollie WP just dropped a cool tutorial on how to <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/start-building-smarter-and-faster-with-synced-patterns/\"><strong>build smarter and faster with synced patterns</strong></a>.

In it she gives some credit to the WordPress community for helping her literally not lose her mind while bombs fell in her neighborhood. Additionally she credits her company, which builds tools for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past I&#8217;ve said &#8220;WordPress won&#8217;t help you. It&#8217;s software, it just sits there.&#8221; But if that software hadn&#8217;t been just sitting there, a group of people in Ukraine wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make <a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/\">this company</a>, to become friends and co-workers, and support each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/402979673479549\">WordCamp Crazy</a></em> is a group of men from Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh that travel together to WordCamps around the world. If that doesn&#8217;t seem odd to you then you don&#8217;t know the history of those three countries.  On the whole they don&#8217;t get along. Yet because WordPress exists these men met on common ground and became friends. Sure it&#8217;s just a small group of people, but it&#8217;s one step in healing the wounds between their countries.  How many other groups or even just two people around the world are like them, that we never hear about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are almost 300 stories on HeroPress now, we&#8217;ve been building it for 10 years. But there are so many more stories that I&#8217;ve heard that never made it to the site. So many lives changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think &#8220;How did this happen?&#8221; and I look at WordPress as a tool. Who built it? So many people. Thousands? Hundreds of thousands?  Millions? Not just core, not just plugins, themes, hacks, tweaks and code. All the support questions answered, all the talks given, all the translations, tutorials, blogs, videos, events, and simply time sitting quietly explaining something to one person who needed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s my point, right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;ve ever contributed to WordPress in any way, YOU did this.  I did this.  WE did this.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about that, and about your impact on the world.

This latest release includes notable changes such as Block Bindings UI, enhancements to the Zoom Out mode, an experimental client-side media processing feature, and some bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the key features and changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Block Bindings UI Moving Out of the Experimental Phase</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant updates in Gutenberg 19.2 is removing the experimental flag from the Block Bindings UI. This feature, now fully integrated into the editor, allows users to link block attributes with external data sources seamlessly. By default, only admin users can create and modify bindings, ensuring greater control and security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicente Canales from the Core team has shared this video in the announcement post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preview Options Extensibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new release also adds extensibility to Preview Options via the Plugin API.Plugin and theme developers can now introduce custom preview options in the block editor’s preview dropdown. This allows users to preview content in different formats or environments, offering more flexibility in how they view their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhanced Zoom Out Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The toolbar now has an “Edit” button, making it easier to switch between modes. Users can also exit Zoom Out mode by double-clicking on blocks and the “Shuffle” block toolbar button has been removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Content-Only Mode Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Content-Only mode, top-level locked blocks now support block styles, providing more consistent designs. Block icons are also now displayed in the toolbar for easier identification.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Client-side Media Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 19.2 introduces an experimental client-side media processing feature. This reduces the server load and potentially improves performance and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable highlights include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A new reorder control is available at the field level on the new view configuration UI.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The minimum supported WordPress version for Create Block is now set to 6.6.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Only admin users are allowed to create and modify block bindings by default.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Block editor improvements include a ‘Reset’ option for the MediaReplaceFlow component and Block Library enhancements include better handling of social icons and pagination blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10 bug fixes, including a fix for pagination arrows pointing the wrong way in RTL languages and resolving an editor error in Safari caused by the checkVisibility method.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been one <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-version-19-2-brokes-the-editor/\">reported issue</a> with this release, where it causes problems with the Web Stories editor. WordPress Core Committer Pascal Birchler has confirmed that the issue is related to Gutenberg and not Web Stories.

Welcome back to another episode of <em>Scaling Enterprise WordPress: The Inside Track</em>. I am one half of your co-hosting duo, back for another really fun episode. We have a really awesome guest, which we&#8217;ll get to in just a second, but as always, I want to welcome Tom, the other half of this show, to the episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Hey, Brad. Hey, great to be here. Excited to be doing another episode. For those that listened to Karim&#8217;s last episode, unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t be on that one as I was on vacation up a mountain with very poor internet, so glad to be back home on the fiber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah. Well, we&#8217;re happy to have you back, and this is going to be a really fun episode, so I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here because we have a really special guest whom we&#8217;d like to introduce now. James Giroux is joining us on the show. Hey, James.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Hello. Hello, everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very excited. If anyone who&#8217;s been in the WordPress industry for a while has probably crossed paths with James at some event or some online endeavor. James, you have a really cool kind of history of your path through WordPress, and one of the reasons I want to set the context of why you&#8217;re on the show about enterprise, I think that&#8217;s important, but then we&#8217;ll dive quickly into how you got there because I think it&#8217;s a really fun journey, and I want to hear a little bit more about it. What really caught my eye, James, was back in July you posted a tweet and a blog post announcing that you started a new role at WordPress VIP under Automattic, and you&#8217;re learning enterprise deeply. So right away that caught my eye because I had never quite heard that phrase, &#8220;learning enterprise deeply,&#8221; but I was like, we got to get James on the show because he is literally doing what we&#8217;re talking about within WordPress and the inside track around enterprise. You have a really great blog post about it, which we&#8217;ll talk about and we&#8217;ll share in the show notes, but I&#8217;d love to hear a little bit about your journey through WordPress, kind of quickly how you got to where you are now. You&#8217;ve touched so many different parts of the WordPress ecosystem that brought you to VIP and the enterprise level side of it. So, let&#8217;s talk about how you got there real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Sure, yeah. I have been in the WordPress ecosystem for, oh, 15-plus years at this point, so it&#8217;s been a long time. Not maybe as long as the two of you, but I&#8217;m chasing your heels a little bit. Like most folks, I got started just looking for something that I could use to build a website. So, that&#8217;s kind of how I got started tinkering, and from there I like to call it the &#8220;four bases of WordPress.&#8221; You&#8217;ve got Marketplace, Agency, Product, and Automattic. Those are the four bases as far as I&#8217;m concerned in WordPress. My journey is like that. That&#8217;s why I called it a home run, but I started out really just on the freelance side, on the agency side, doing work for customers, clients, all that kind of thing. Then from there, I ended up working with a product called PageLines, which was one of the early pioneers of this whole page builder concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />I remember PageLines. Yeah, that was a long time ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />A very long time ago. So I worked there developing themes and plugins for that ecosystem, and that&#8217;s really what kind of launched me into WordPress at a community level, was my involvement there. I was hired by PageLines eventually as their Director of Operations, working with developers and things like that. From there, I met some folks from Envato at PressNomics. I was at PressNomics 3, hanging out, driving around, and ended up hearing about a role at Envato. So, I joined Envato in 2016 as their WordPress evangelist, which was great. I could continue to go to all the events that I really wanted to go to and get paid for it, which was a really neat and novel thing at the time. After about five years there, I moved to Gravity Forms and worked at one of these pillar product companies in the WordPress ecosystem. Then I was at StellarWP, working with all the folks over there. I was a Director of Brand and Product Marketing there, then transitioned out of that, and now I am at Automattic in WordPress VIP as a Technical Account Manager. Bit of a career swap, but I&#8217;m loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very cool. Yeah, no, I think one thing that stands out about your story is just, and I like to talk about the community and the impact of engaging, meeting people, and going to events. I know things are a little different than they were maybe 10 or 15 years ago, but there&#8217;s still a lot of value in those events. Like you said, your career path was just by attending and being present, meeting people, and talking to people. It shaped your career and kind of opened some doors that maybe otherwise would&#8217;ve been harder to open, going in without any kind of a warm lead or knowing people within that company or within that industry. So, just want to touch on that, get out there because it can absolutely help in the growth of your career and what your goals are and your aspirations, which is another reason why I love this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, going into really focusing on where you&#8217;re at now and some of the goals that you&#8217;re looking to accomplish, going back to that &#8220;learning enterprise deeply.&#8221; You posted this a few months ago, so I have to imagine you have not learned everything about enterprise in a couple of months. I think you probably have a little bit further to go, but I&#8217;d love to hear a little bit about early on—it&#8217;s been about a month and a half since your post and you&#8217;ve kind of dug into this a bit—but what are some of the things that really stand out? Maybe some of the challenges, or things that were unexpected or maybe even expected, but what really stood out just in the last month and a half, two months since you&#8217;ve been in this new role?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly! Here&#8217;s the continuation of the transcript with corrected spelling and punctuation:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think one of the things about enterprise that folks on the outside maybe don&#8217;t understand is you really don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. I think that for me has been the first little bit of learning here—it&#8217;s learning what I don&#8217;t know. I didn’t really know what a DXP was before joining WordPress VIP—that’s a Digital Experience Platform, for those who don’t know. I didn’t really understand the role that WordPress played in larger enterprise infrastructure and how it integrates, and the kinds of complexities at a technical level that a lot of enterprises deal with. Nor would I, because so much of my past experience has been very direct WordPress, where you have one application, you have one WordPress installation that you’re responsible for, and you have to be concerned about that at a very small scale. In terms of traffic, all the concerns are very different, and looking at how do I scale that thinking out and look at the kinds of challenges that exist. So, that’s been really interesting. The sales cycle has been interesting. The role of technology service providers, or technology platforms like VIP, and the relationship they have with agencies, and how those work together. The role they play, and the relationships they need to develop with product companies as well, and how that factors into how we deliver solutions to customers and clients. It’s a very interesting nut to crack, and I’m enjoying it. Yeah, it’s so much to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />We could probably do an entire show on sales cycles, couldn’t we, Tom? I mean that’s, oh boy. That might be a little bit of a trigger for both of us as agency owners in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, we’re both jealous of you not knowing about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah. It’s interesting you mentioned not knowing what you don’t know, and I think when the larger community hears &#8220;enterprise&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221; specifically, I think the assumption is it’s a big website with a lot of content, a lot of writers, most likely a lot of users in the backend, and a lot of traffic, which is by and large pretty true, but there’s a lot more than that. That’s kind of the surface level of what enterprise entails. All the behind-the-scenes stuff of integrating with SSO and different providers and APIs, and all the security requirements that go into it that are well outside of Core WordPress. It can absolutely work with WordPress, but it takes more advanced teams to make those things happen. So when you really get under the hood of what the enterprise work is with WordPress, it’s so much more than just big websites with a lot of traffic—a way I like to describe it. But there’s a lot more than that when you start peeling back that onion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Absolutely. It’s been really interesting looking at the number of people that need to be involved, and you can’t really get away from it. You think, &#8220;Oh, it’s just a big website with more traffic.&#8221; But no, I mean it’s bigger projects, there are more stakeholders, there are more moving parts that you may or may not understand or know about. There’s a lot of extra discovery that goes into it. It’s been really interesting watching different projects that we’ve gotten different customers on. So, we’ve got customers that are just starting and getting ready to launch and going through that process of migrating from maybe an existing build they have on a different platform or on a different WordPress installation over onto the VIP architecture. And then you’ve got those that have been on VIP architecture for a while and sort of what maintenance looks like in that cycle and how that goes forward. It’s really, really interesting. And just the number of people involved at all different levels and the ongoing work and the constant communication that needs to happen at an enterprise level is way different from running a local restaurant or running a local e-commerce retail shop&#8217;s website. It’s very, very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, no doubt. Tom, what do you got over there? I don’t want to monopolize this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, I’m keen to dive a little bit into some of the stuff that you raised in the blog post that you wrote calling on the WordPress ecosystem to embrace enterprise. So, why’d you write it? I guess this phrase “learn enterprise deeply”—we’ve typically reserved that phrase for pretty important things. I think Matt’s only used it twice, for JavaScript and then for AI. So, why do you think enterprise is that important to the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Well, as a community, as a content management system platform and open source, we’ve done a really good job of hitting the ones and twos, right? We are really good at being a first choice for a lot of folks that are looking for a website that delivers minimal traffic concerns, no compliance, no security—none of that kind of stuff. But if we want to grow the ecosystem beyond the ones and twos to the hundreds and the thousands, we really need to look at where a lot of folks work. They work in government, they work in large enterprise, they’re on marketing teams of thousands rather than marketing teams of five. There are intranets and extranets and all of that kind of stuff where WordPress has an opportunity to flex its muscles. And we have maybe not fully understood that or cared so much about it. Like all folks, we take the path of least resistance. We go for what’s easiest first. We’ve done easy. We’ve accomplished easy. And now it’s time to accomplish what’s maybe a little bit harder. My whole pitch, my whole thinking behind that is, if we want to see WordPress grow to 80% market share—which I know is probably a pipe dream—but if we want to double what we’re currently at, 43%, and get to 86%, then we need to get into these enterprises because that’s where young people are going to work as well. They’re not all going into startups, they’re not all building apps for themselves and doing things for themselves. They need to find a job, and they’re getting jobs in banks and pharmaceutical companies and all these other places. If the tooling that they’re being provided is Sitecore or Adobe, whatever Adobe is running with, they’re not getting the best of what the web can be. And so, that for me is one of the reasons, because once they’re experienced with WordPress in work—when they’re paid to use WordPress in their day-to-day—that’s going to leak out into their side projects because that’s the platform they’re most familiar with. That’s how we grow adoption. That’s how we grow WordPress in my opinion, and actually get it to a place where it’s solving the really hard problems of the web that folks have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />That’s a super interesting take, because it’s like actually probably a lot of the early growth of WordPress was almost the opposite of that, right? People were not using it at work, but they were discovering it and using it for their own stuff. They were blogging, they were using it for their kids’ football team or whatever, and a lot of the early penetration into business was people using it for their side projects and then bringing it with them, fighting the good fight internally: &#8220;Why don’t we use this WordPress thing for our site? I’ve been using it, it’s great.&#8221; Maybe we’re transitioning out of that, and actually it needs to become the default at work so that all these young people who get jobs are introduced to it there. I love that take. I’ve never really quite thought of it in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />I think even early on, as WordPress really started transforming from a blogging platform to a true CMS, back when custom post types were introduced and it really became an option for the enterprise, getting some of those early enterprise clients also really helped validate it for everybody. I know it made my job easier as an agency owner when I said, &#8220;Hey, we just launched something on microsoft.com with WordPress.&#8221; So, everybody we talked to at that point, the idea of “Is it secure? Can we use it?”—those questions really went out the window once we said, &#8220;Well, Microsoft’s using it, and they did a full-blown security audit on it.&#8221; So that in some way also helped, I think probably more in that mid-market, to say, &#8220;Hey, we can actually use this when we just thought it was a blogging platform.&#8221; So, I think even that early on, just getting a couple of those key large enterprise brands on WordPress, and we could all point to them as a community and say, &#8220;Look what these brands are doing,&#8221; that really helped accelerate WordPress into the CMS market and has continued to, because I still use those examples. But we don’t have to answer those questions anymore, or certainly not as often. &#8220;Is it secure? Is it a blogging platform?&#8221;—those are long gone, right? The enterprise has helped squash that, in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, I completely agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I’m interested in enterprise WordPress’s place within the wider ecosystem, the awareness of it, the role it plays—maybe what your perspective was on that or your awareness of it before, and how that’s shifted since. And maybe, therefore, what you think we need to do more as an enterprise WordPress community, as the subset of the WordPress community that’s focused on enterprise, to better showcase actually how successful WordPress is in enterprise. You were saying you joined VIP, and you get exposed to quite a lot of stuff, and you’re like, &#8220;Oh, I perhaps didn’t actually know WordPress was being used</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in these ways or the level of complexity.&#8221; It’s a bit of an iceberg problem I think we have, where there’s quite a lot more happening than perhaps people realize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think there are a couple things to that. Before I really dove deep into enterprise, I couldn’t find anything on WordPress enterprise. There was nothing out there I could read, there’s nothing out there I could go to. I mean, I could go to events—and I did—and I’m very grateful to folks who would invite me to show up at their enterprise events. But I didn’t know how to even jump into those conversations or start them, and that’s a big part of it. I couldn’t go to a WordCamp and get a 101 talk on enterprise. We joke about the sales cycle, but it’s so intimidating. But where’s the opportunity for agencies that are looking to build out their freelancer bench to talk about what does it actually take to become an enterprise freelancer or to work in this space? Or how can we equip you to be able to jump into what we need? There’s none of that. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons why I wrote that blog post—to sort of wave a bit of that flag and say, &#8220;Hey, I can’t even find anything to help me get started on the path toward enterprise.&#8221; And the reality is that what’s going to end up happening is folks that are really good at Drupal—not that that’s bad—but that’s sort of where enterprise is, or they’re really good at Sitecore, and they’re going to go, &#8220;Okay, well, we’ll expand our toolset, maybe we’ll look at WordPress,&#8221; but they’re not really going to be from the community. They’re not going to be part of the story of what we’ve been, and it’s going to make it harder for those of us who truly understand what WordPress is all about to get in front of these enterprises that are looking, possibly, at WordPress as a tool, and helping them understand what this ecosystem and this community is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that’s one thing. I think, what can enterprise folks be doing? You need to get out there more. This is hard because I’ve been here a couple months now, and I haven’t written a blog post since my announcement post because my brain is so packed with all of the things that I’m trying to learn and understand, the complexities, and just all the things that I’m finding it hard to sit down and write. What do I write about? What do I talk about now? So, I need to get out there and do that. And that’s what we need more of. We need more enterprise champions showing up at WordPress events, at WordCamps, doing things like this podcast—which I think is fantastic—and just really talking through what does it mean to be enterprise WordPress? What are the challenges we’re facing? How do we invite folks in? How do we get product folks in who maybe have no idea how their product is being used in an enterprise setting? I’ve got a call coming up with one product company that has no enterprise pricing, no enterprise service level, but their product is being used in a really intense way on a customer’s website. What’s really cool is being able to facilitate that as somebody who’s got both the community side and the enterprise side now, but we need more of those relationships to develop between WordPress product companies and enterprise agencies and enterprise infrastructure companies—I would call VIP. Let’s get them all around the same table and talking. The product companies don’t have any clue how their products are being used at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean that’s definitely a common problem I see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, and thank you for calling out the podcast because honestly, one of the reasons we’re doing this is because there aren’t enough people in the WordPress ecosystem, WordPress space, talking about enterprise and sharing our knowledge and information. Getting people like you, James, on to share your experiences, your learning, and where you’re at, because there just hasn’t really been a lot of this, even going back across the 15 years or so that we’ve all been doing this. There hasn’t really been a lot of dedication around enterprise, talking about it, challenges, what can we do to help push it? It’s another reason why we’re all really excited, and Tom and I are both a part of the Scale Consortium, which for years I think many of us kind of looked at Automattic, and maybe even VIP in a sense, and said, &#8220;Help us, sell us in the enterprise. Help push us into the enterprise.&#8221; But the reality is it was on all of us to do that. So, it took a little bit of time, but finally all the agencies were able to get together that work in that space, in the WordPress enterprise space, and say, &#8220;Look, if we work together on helping spread positive information and what people are doing in WordPress enterprise, it’s going to help all of us.&#8221; And so now the Scale Consortium exists exactly for that reason. We’re really pushing into the space to help spread awareness, spread information, help people learn around enterprise, have events at WordCamps or other webinars, share that information. Because you’re right, I think many of us agency owners especially, it’s trial by fire. Did I start WebDev thinking I want to get into enterprise? No. But when Microsoft walks through your door or a big brand walks through your door, you learn it real quick, right? Not going to tell them no. So, I love that you call that out. Exactly why we’re doing this. We’re hoping to get more of this in, between the show we’re doing here, and then with Karim and Tom. Even though we’re early, I feel like the information we’re getting out there—these are conversations that have not been happening in the public, and they need to be happening. So, I love it, and I’m hoping that the audience is also understanding what we’re trying to do here and getting some value out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean I hope that you do keep blogging as well, James, actually, because I’ve read your blog for a long time, long before you were writing about enterprise, so I’m kind of even more excited to read it now that you’re in enterprise, which is a space that’s even closer to my interests. The listeners to this show should all go and start reading it—that’ll add to the pressure for you to then give them some content that’s relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I don’t know if it’s writer’s block or if it’s just my brain is full of all the things, but I’ve been challenged. I’m going to WordCamp US and I’m looking forward to the conversations. WordCamp US is really exciting for me this year because of Showcase Day, and because it’s a really good opportunity for enterprise to have its moment in the sun, so to speak, and the spotlight. We get to see innovation, we get to see scale, and it’s so exciting that somebody’s starting to pick that up a bit. I’m looking forward to the kinds of conversations it spurs. I’m curious what I’m going to be thinking about after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I think it’s going to be super interesting. I mean, I agree, it’s a really exciting evolution. I know even last year there was the NASA keynote, which was almost a precursor to this Showcase Day, and that’s a really great evolution. It’s going to be interesting—probably the first time there’s going to be a day with all of those people who are doing this kind of work, all there, showcasing together. The conversations afterward—I’m pretty interested to see what the floor traffic is like, and the kind of conversations that come off the back of that, the collaboration. Hopefully that opens up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />There’ll probably be some surprises in those showcases, too. There are going to be some things that kind of blow us all away—like, &#8220;Oh wow, look what they built, look what they did.&#8221; I mean, just WordCamp last year with NASA.gov and the big push there and the presentations was honestly digging into understanding the amount of data and what they worked through was pretty mind-blowing. And obviously, it was all behind the scenes until they presented that. So, it was just fun to hear more of the challenges, more in how they worked through those with NASA, especially with the amount of content, which was absolutely insane, that they had to migrate into a block-based system. So, it’s fun sharing that stuff, it’s fun hearing it. I’m glad it is more focused. I know Matt used to—Matt Mullenweg—used to mention some highlights in his State of the Word, but he’s kind of gotten away from that, and probably for good reason, because he doesn’t want to play favorites when you’re showing off what other companies did. That could come off as playing favorites. So, I’m excited about that, too, because I’m sure there are going to be some interesting surprises—projects none of us knew were even out there, things that happened, and we’ll be like, &#8220;Oh, wow, I’m going to be telling some of my clients about that because that’s cool.&#8221; Sharing the information around enterprise, sharing out there. I know it’s not all enterprise—it’s just showcasing WordPress—but I have a feeling there’ll be a few big showcases in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I’m excited to see our enterprise customers and clients in the WordPress ecosystem having their time to present what WordPress means to them and how they’re using WordPress from their mouths, from their perspective, and what will it mean. The WordPress ecosystem is very different from the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>way the rest of the world operates. We’re kind of nice. And because we’re kind of nice and because we’re kind of kind to folks, the way we operate and interoperate together is a little bit different, and that can throw folks for a loop that are coming from other industries. And so, it’ll be really neat to see what happens when you get these big publishers that are competitors in the publishing landscape together, showcasing how they’re using the same technology platform to achieve their goals and do things, and what’s going to happen when they start talking to each other off the stage and see some of that WordPress culture, that WordPress community vibe sort of leak into how they interact with each other. There’s just something really cool about that that I’m looking forward to seeing happen, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />And honestly, just in WordPress in general, I feel like that is the vibe. People want to share. And maybe honestly, it’s the open-source vibe. It’s not just WordPress. It’s like if you’re into open-source and you’re into it enough that you’re going to attend an event about a piece of software, I’ve got to believe there’s some passion behind it. You’re proud and excited about what you’re doing, and you want to share it—even if you’re sharing it with competitors, you want to say, &#8220;Hey, look at the cool things we’re doing over here.&#8221; And they’re probably, like you said, sharing some things they’re doing that you weren’t aware of or you might be interested in. It’s similar to what agencies are doing and freelancers—we’re all showing off our work, like, &#8220;Look at this cool thing we built.&#8221; So, you’re right. Seeing actual owners of websites, publishers, really showing off and sharing information is going to be pretty neat. It’s just open-source. We’re all out there trying to build and help each other and just build an awesome platform that we can all use. So, I’d like to talk just a little bit about some of the goals. What are some of your longer-term goals within this new role? What kind of impact are you looking to make around organizations, clients, or just WordPress in general? We’ve talked about it being just a month and a half—it’s still a fairly new role for you—but long-term, your vision, what kind of impact are you looking to make?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Well, I’ve packed up 15 years of marketing experience and taken that hat off and put on the account management hat. It’s a bit of a career reset for me, which is kind of neat to do. Long-term…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Maybe a little scary too, huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, it is. It’s very scary. You’re sort of starting from ground zero again, but with 15 years of experience, it’s kind of cool actually to do that. My first goal is to become the best technical account manager in the world. So, that’s maybe the entrepreneur in me going, &#8220;Take over the world!&#8221; or whatever. But I want to be the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I like that. That’s only the first goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, that’s the first goal: be the best I can be, be the best that I can do, support my team, be somebody they can count on, bring all of the knowledge and depth of experience I have across the WordPress ecosystem into this role and add value to these relationships, and add value. That’s the number one thing. Maybe selfishly—we don’t really have a lot of—this sounds so funny to say—but enterprise WordPress influencers. Why not be an ambassador for enterprise WordPress? We need more folks that are championing the transition from one side of WordPress to the other and opening those doors, and it’s something I did all throughout my career in the rest of WordPress, so I don’t see why I couldn’t do that at the enterprise level and just connect folks to each other, connect partners. So many of our product companies just need a door to be opened for them or exposure to what’s going on in enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean I’d love to do an episode actually on enterprise for WordPress product companies. Of all the parts of WordPress, I think they’re the ones that seem to have cracked enterprise the least. But like you say, there are lots of enterprise companies that are discovering their stuff and using it, and there’s a lot of opportunity there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Please start charging more for products because enterprise, they don’t want to pay $99 a year. They just won’t trust it if it’s that cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />But the issue isn’t the $99, it’s the fact that they’re not going to get the level of service and access to a team that they need. Every build is unique. We think that folks in enterprise are just using WordPress as vanilla WordPress—they’re not. They’re taking WordPress, and they’re molding it and shaping it into something that works for them. They’re rebranding it internally. They have different names for it as a tool, and they can do that because they’re paying millions of dollars a year to do that. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, yeah, there we go. Add that on the list, Brad, for a future episode because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I love that idea, Tom. I love that. And talk about enterprise influencers. I mean, I’ve got to be honest, Tom’s got the look, he’s got the style, he’s got the voice—just lacking the influence! The stars are aligning, Tom, I’m telling you. But I do think I love it because, like we talked about, getting more content out there—and honestly, even YouTube and videos are so popular now, more popular than ever, and it’s really gaining traction. And within the WordPress space, there’s just a lot of great video content out there, and I expect that’s only going to continue to grow, especially in the enterprise space too, as that usually catches up once the masses are out there doing it. But yeah, more content, more information, sharing resources, getting people talking about more of the challenges, talking about the FUD that’s out there from other platforms, talking about WordPress and how we kind of speak back to that and alleviate those concerns. So, enterprise is a big topic, and there is a lot to dig into, which is one of the reasons we’re doing this. We bring on awesome people like you, James, and really understand where you’re at, your experiences. And what I would love to do is have you come back on the show maybe in six months, maybe next year at some point, and really circle back through your progression. What has transpired? Did you expect it? What have you learned? Things like that. Since you are a little bit new into the role, I think it’ll be fun to have you back on a little bit later next year and kind of dig back into where we’re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />When you’re a grizzled and tired enterprise WordPress expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />After the honeymoon period is over and I’m into the day-to-day grind. Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, after the old honeymoon period. But it’s pretty exciting. Just to wind down a little bit, any kind of final thoughts around the enterprise space and really what’s just top of mind for you, James? We talked about short-term goals, some longer-term goals, but really what’s top of mind for you in the space and where you’re looking to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think, like that blog post says, we’ve got a lot of opportunity to help people get a better grasp of what enterprise actually looks like. I think WordPress is ready. I think a lot of our product companies and even our hosting companies that are maybe more downstream are ready to make the leap. They just need some help figuring out what that looks like. I would like to see more of that happening. Maybe I’ll write about that. Actually, that’s a good topic for me to sort of follow up on. What am I thinking about? What are my final thoughts? I’m curious to see how we as CMS folks—not just as WordPress—start to navigate thought leadership more broadly. WordPress, we’re competing against Adobe, we’re competing against some other proprietary platforms. We’re going up against these monolith DXPs, and we’re advocating for composability—all words that make sense to folks that are in enterprise, but maybe don’t make sense to anybody outside of it. But we have an opportunity to lead the pack when it comes to innovation. AI, we’re so much more agile than a lot of these other platforms are, and I would love to see us moving more in that direction as well, more broadly, and bringing more folks who maybe have sold themselves to these other platforms to come over and see what it’s like. The grass is very much greener over here. So, yeah, those are the things I’m thinking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Come on over. We’re very friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean, that ties back perfectly into the need for more influencers, right? Because I think actually the biggest need for influencers is to project that vision that we have—that WordPress has for enterprise—out into the world. At the moment, most of the buzzwords and categories and descriptions of what enterprise CMS is are set by our competitors, set by the analysts. And we tend to play catch-up, and we tend to say, &#8220;Oh, WordPress could do that,&#8221; but they’re the ones that came up with what that is. And then we’re scrambling to try and prove WordPress could do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s exactly right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Actually, perhaps with folks like you getting out and saying, &#8220;Well, actually, this is what WordPress’s vision for enterprise CMS is,&#8221; that’s super exciting. I think if we can start doing that—that’s a great point, Tom. That’s the next era of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. Well, this has been a really fun show. Appreciate you coming on, James. You mentioned you’re going to be at WordCamp US coming up, which is September 17th through the 20th out in Portland, Oregon. I will be there as well. Tom, are you going to make the trek over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I will be there, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, you’ll be there. It’s a long flight for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />It’s a long flight for me, so I’m stopping in New York on the way, so I’m not coming as far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Okay, well, that’ll help break up the flight a little bit. But anywhere else people can find you online, James? You want to plug your blog or any social networks where people can interact with you if someone wants to chase you down and say hi?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, absolutely. My blog, <a href=\"https://jamesgiroux.ca\">JamesGiroux.ca</a> is a great place. My handle pretty much everywhere is JamesGiroux, so you can find me on X (formerly known as Twitter), LinkedIn, or give you my Gravatar—yeah, so it’s all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very cool. Well, I look forward to seeing you in person there. I’m definitely going to track you down at WordCamp US and get a little FaceTime. Really appreciate you coming on the show, James, and we’re looking forward to following your progress and really rooting for you and rooting for the enterprise. And we’re here to support, however, as obviously, this is important to all of us, as well as a lot of people out there. So, I’m excited we’re doing the show. I’m excited we’re talking about it, we’re getting people like you that are talking about it, blogging about it, and right in the middle of it. So, this is exactly what we’re looking to showcase with this platform. It’s been a lot of fun. So, Tom, anything you want to plug before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />No, just to say thank you for the work that you’ve been doing so far, especially the blogging and the influencing. That’s, I think, a big gap. So, keep doing that. And yeah, looking forward to talking more about WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. Well, for Tom, I’m Brad Williams. This is <em>Scaling Enterprise: The Inside Track</em>. We will see you on the next episode. See you, everyone.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <em><strong>Scaling Enterprise WordPress: The Inside Track</strong></em>, co-hosts <strong>Brad Williams</strong> and <strong>Tom Willmot</strong> discuss the evolving role of WordPress in the enterprise space with special guest J<strong>ames Giroux, Technical Account Manager at WordPress VIP.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>James shares insights from his 15-year journey through the WordPress ecosystem, touching on his experiences across freelancing, product development, and enterprise-level projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation covers key topics such as the challenges and opportunities of scaling WordPress for large organizations, the importance of community and networking in career development, and the future of WordPress in the enterprise market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also highlights the need for more enterprise WordPress champions, the role of thought leadership in driving adoption, and the exciting developments to come at WordCampUS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Enterprise in WordPress Growth:</strong> James emphasizes that for WordPress to continue its growth and dominance in the CMS market, it must break into enterprise-level organizations, which house large teams and complex systems. The WordPress community has historically catered to smaller users, but scaling up is necessary for future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning Enterprise Deeply:</strong> James shares his experience transitioning into the enterprise space, learning about complex systems, technical challenges, and the unique needs of large-scale organizations. He introduces terms like DXP (Digital Experience Platform) and highlights how enterprise WordPress involves more than just a large website—it&#8217;s about integrating with systems, APIs, security, and compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Community and Networking in Career Development:</strong> All three hosts stress the importance of attending events, engaging with the community, and making connections to advance in the WordPress ecosystem. James credits much of his career growth to attending events like WordCamp and building relationships within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in the Enterprise Space:</strong> There are many moving parts when it comes to WordPress in the enterprise—more stakeholders, longer sales cycles, complex integrations, and technical requirements. James points out that many people in the WordPress community might not realize the depth of these challenges until they dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Opportunity for Product Companies</strong>: WordPress product companies often don’t realize how their tools are being used at an enterprise level. There’s a need for more collaboration between product companies and enterprise organizations to align pricing models, service levels, and support structures that suit large-scale projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Influencers in the Enterprise WordPress Space</strong>: There is a growing need for WordPress &#8220;enterprise influencers&#8221;—people who can champion WordPress as a solution for large organizations and communicate its advantages to a broader audience. By doing so, WordPress can challenge competitors like Adobe and Sitecore more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Value of Events Like WordCamp US</strong>: Events like WordCamp US provide a platform for showcasing what WordPress can achieve at scale. Presentations like NASA’s website migration highlight WordPress’s capabilities for handling massive projects, and these showcases help promote WordPress as a serious contender in the enterprise CMS space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long-term Goals in Enterprise WordPress</strong>: James is focused on becoming a top-tier Technical Account Manager while also serving as an ambassador for enterprise WordPress, bridging the gap between the community and large organizations. His long-term goal is to help more companies adopt WordPress by educating and advocating for its enterprise capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://jamesgiroux.ca\">James Giroux’s Blog</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpvip.com\">WordPress VIP</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org\">WordCampUS</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://nasa.gov\">NASA</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://scaleconsortium.org/\">Scale Consortium</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 09:18:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Inside Out 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=125328\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2024/09/inside-out-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:337:\"<p>It&#8217;s a tough pick, but I think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2\">Inside Out 2</a> might be my favorite <a href=\"https://www.pixar.com/\">Pixar</a> movie.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enhanced WordPress with AI translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias has extensive experience in the technology and creative sectors, and is currently working as the co-founder of FluentC AI, an AI powered language technology company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a background in technology, he&#8217;s focusing on developing solutions to enhance communication across different languages and platforms. He&#8217;s been involved with WordPress since its early days, around version 1.2, and has a rich history of web design and consulting, having worked on hundreds of WordPress websites. But it&#8217;s only recently that he&#8217;s become more engaged in the WordPress community through events like WordCamp Buffalo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast today, we talk about AI driven language translations, particularly focusing on Matthias&#8217;s work with FluentC, which is his translation plugin for WordPress. It supports multithreaded simultaneous translations of up to 140 languages, enabling your pages and posts to be offered in other languages in just a few moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We covered the differences between AI models designed for translation, such as ChatGPT, and Llama, which aren&#8217;t specialized for this task, and how his platform builds a contextual layer above those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He emphasizes the importance of context and diverse multi-lingual data in producing high quality translations. FluentC&#8217;s functionality involves local storage of translated content in an effort to maintain website speed. This is done using native WordPress hooks, and URL modifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias also offers his thoughts on the ongoing multi-lingual support phase of the Gutenberg project. And his hopes for FluentC to evolve from a standalone plugin to an API, which could be used by WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the broader implications of AI in translation, the need for open source models to compete in this rapidly evolving space, and the parallels between AI evolution and past trends like blockchain, and web 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the intersection of AI and WordPress, or looking to enhance your website&#8217;s multi-lingual capabilities, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Matthias Pupillo. How you doing Matthias?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> I&#8217;m doing fantastic, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very, very nice to have you with us. We had a little bit of a chat before we pressed record, and in that chat, Matthias revealed to me that he&#8217;s got a long history with WordPress, but not necessarily the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias, we&#8217;re going to be talking about AI, transcribing, transliteration, multilingual, all that kind of stuff today. Before we do, would you just give us a quick potted bio of your history with tech, WordPress, however far you want to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Oh yeah, absolutely. So I&#8217;ve been a software, I have to say commercially, building software for 25 years. I&#8217;ve been recreationally building software for 35 years. So I started pretty much when I was eight building code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I started in WordPress with 1.2. I was writing hand coded HTML in Microsoft notes, and so it was a dramatic shift back then in 2002, 2003.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was running my own consulting firm, doing web design professionally, and found WordPress by, it was a divine intervention one day. Someone wanted to pay me for editing, and I didn&#8217;t know how to write software, besides HTML, CSS and Java. And Java back then was not building a website. It was a complicated journey and it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day WordPress 2.5.5, when we had tabs, that was great. And then we got 2.6 and it went horizontal menu, that was a fun day. It&#8217;s been a long road with WordPress. I think I&#8217;ve built two or three hundred websites with it, maybe more. Not to mention coaching, staffing, and like guidance from an architecture standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really long and storied, well, a really long story basically, so that&#8217;s lovely. But however, one of the things that you said a moment ago was that, although you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for a long time, the community side of it is more recent I think. Only in the fairly recent past that you&#8217;ve got yourself out to events, and started to interact with the community more. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Yeah, so I built the translation company FluentC, we built for apps, and GraphQL, and other integrations. And I forgot WordPress, I really did. Our website was built in WordPress, our marketing flow, our CRM, everything was in WordPress, and I forgot to build the engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of my shame of forgetting that, I rapidly built the plugin. Then spent four months trying to get it approved, and then joined the community in person. And my first WordCamp was in Buffalo this last May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You alluded to it earlier, but I might as well get the URL out there. So FluentC is the URL, but it&#8217;s not what you are thinking, I suspect. I imagine you are thinking it ends in a Y, but my records here show that it&#8217;s fluent, and then the letter C, so F-L-U-E-N-T-C, dot io. So, fluent, the letter C, dot io. What is this service? And we&#8217;ll come to the WordPress component in a moment. But obviously you built the SaaS version, if you like, first. What is its MVP, if you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so it came out of a problem that, I&#8217;ve built a lot of apps for healthcare, and it always offended me that they were only in one language. And the cost, time and effort to build a multi-language app was just always put to the back end of the priority list. And in healthcare it&#8217;s incredibly important that the patient knows what the directions are, knows what the medications are, knows what their appointments are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I built FluentC to handle that, and to build that multi-language, make it app developer friendly, our SaaS component is a no code solution, no code translation. If you want it native, are built into the app itself, use our GraphQL, and our i18next integrations. And then it was just, it just had to exist because of, patients need that native touch, and it needs to be super easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer tools are always built by people who aren&#8217;t developers, it has always been a sore point my side, that people just cannot, developers are not the first thought. Like you have to write code for a living, we have to make this easy for you. So we built that first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just ask, in the US, given that you&#8217;ve mentioned the healthcare industry, in the US is there an obligation for that particular industry to have things translated into multiple languages? Here in the UK where I&#8217;m based, if you are going to produce something and it&#8217;s going to go into a hospital, for example, I think there is legislation around that. I don&#8217;t know what the cornucopia of languages are, but I know that there is some responsibility there. Is the same true in the US? Does it cover a particular bunch of languages? Is there a minimum requirement that you can have before you can say that&#8217;s done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, there is a minimum number of, relative minimum number of, languages. It varies state by state, and it&#8217;s for the in-person experience. If you show up to the hospital and you only speak Spanish, they have to have someone in the building that speaks Spanish, or a translator available by phone. Or if you speak Russian, or Czech, or Slovakian. And they have to take care of you, and they have to treat you, and they have to give you care, and then they hand you the directions to leave in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They send you your email notifications in English. After just saving your life in Croatian, they then hand you an English sheet of paper with the directions on how to get your next step care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obligation, you know, Canada has that hard list obligation of two languages, French Canadian and English. But the US is sort of the in-person experience, but not the digital experience. Not your emails, not your text messages, your notifications. None of that is compelled to be in multilanguage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s turn our attention away from healthcare and just think about, I don&#8217;t know, like an e-commerce store or something like that. I guess this whole idea of getting things translated just makes perfect sense over there as well. Because for the last 10 years we&#8217;ve been all getting more and more into buying things online from our mobile phones, in the comfort of our own homes, sitting in an armchair and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And increasingly, a lot of the properties are crossing international borders, so it&#8217;s not difficult for me to buy from a US company, or a European company that isn&#8217;t based where I am, knowing that the shipping and everything will be taken care of. But I guess the language component, for me, I am only an English speaker. So if I, for example, was to come across a great deal on a French website, I wouldn&#8217;t know what it was because it would simply be in French. So I guess there is a real good economic argument if you are hoping to participate in international trade, there&#8217;s a really good compelling argument to get behind this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> There really is because e-commerce is one of the ones that is, once you fulfill the product, you&#8217;re done. You&#8217;ve shipped it. Some amount of people will call support, some will email, some will use chat. For the majority, overwhelming majority, of e-commerce sales, it&#8217;s ship it, and you&#8217;re done. You really don&#8217;t care if the person that spoke only German. You ship them the great product, maybe you have multi-language directions if they need directions, we should be designing products that don&#8217;t need directions, like a T-shirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yes, the ability for a website and e-commerce to have those additional keywords in those native languages adds billions of potential customers. We did the analysis, and if you just cover Hindi, Chinese, English, French, and German, it&#8217;s about five languages, you add about 4.2 billion potential customers. You&#8217;re adding millions of new keywords. You&#8217;ve spent so much time, most of our WordPress, and the Woo people, spend so much time optimising their titles, their descriptions, their framework for communication on their products, and then that&#8217;s it, it&#8217;s in one language. And it&#8217;s perfect, it&#8217;s beautiful, but it really doesn&#8217;t serve them for 4 billion customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We support about 140 languages. There&#8217;s about 40 languages that cover 8 billion people. Those searches are the key. You can expand at no cost, your SEO presence, just by having the translations built in in a search engine optimised way. And e-commerce fulfillment, all your tools, that&#8217;s an email and chat. The phone one, you&#8217;re going to struggle with, you may have to build some extra capabilities. That&#8217;s where the 4 billion customers need to make enough revenue for you to have some support for them. But if you have 4 billion new customers available to you and you don&#8217;t have the revenue, I&#8217;d like to question your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from an e-commerce standpoint, selling globally is super easy now. Woo handles the transactions, handles the currency, you can get some plugins for that. You can do the fulfillment. It&#8217;s super easy to cover all the taxes, but you forgot the descriptions. You forgot the titles, the tags, the meta tags, all of that stuff. And the AI translation these days, because you need a special language model, you&#8217;re using special descriptions, and they&#8217;re really good at this. It really is a known thing to translate, and it&#8217;s super easy to adjust and bring in that new traffic. And I think that&#8217;s the important thing about e-commerce, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we rewind the clock, I don&#8217;t know, 25 years or something, before the internet had taken off, apart from a bunch of really nerdy academics at CERN or something like that, the idea of owning a shop which would be communicating globally was really more or less pie in the sky. You know, there are a few giant companies that we all know of that were crossing international boundaries, car manufacturers and things like that, these giant entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people who had a regular shop, which you might describe as a bricks and mortar shop, they&#8217;re not going to be doing that because they&#8217;re locally based, there&#8217;s no prospect of doing that, all of it is completely out of bounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then along comes the internet. Suddenly the boundaries are collapsing. And although it&#8217;s still probably out of bounds for many people, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious to any store owner that you can ship things. All of that shipping capability has been taken care of, the logistics can be taken care of by somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this missing piece. And I guess, again, if we rewind the clock about 25 years. The idea of translating things must have been fabulously expensive, because for every piece of text that you wished to translate, presumably you had to get a human being to read it, spend time wrangling it, and then giving you the translation, which you would then need to print in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, the advent of AI, and I know that AI is all the rage at the moment, but it does seem like a lot of the AI stuff is kind of hype. And some of it might have utility, but much of it doesn&#8217;t seem to have utility. But it really feels like the translation piece is really credible. I don&#8217;t know how perfectly accurate it is, whether it&#8217;s 95% from English to French, say, or 99.9, I don&#8217;t really know, but because that&#8217;s such a logical thing to do, it does seem like an area in which a computer could excel at. Is that the case? Is translation from one language to another, do computers do this increasingly well, accurately?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, computers are doing it very well. And it is a different AI than the ChatGPT. ChatGPT, Llama, some of those things are terrible at translations, you need a special one for it. And the special ones are getting of standard, by the book translations very good. They&#8217;re still very bad at a couple of things, colloquialisms. We have a great phrase, six of one, half a dozen of the other, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense in Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We lose such great things, like there&#8217;s a wonderful Spanish word, an event called the quinceañera, which is your 15th birthday party. There&#8217;s cultural significance in language that we lose. And we are trying to fix that. Everyone&#8217;s trying to fix that. It&#8217;s as bad as it&#8217;s going to be. But as far as formal communication goes, if you were setting a date and a time for an event, or you were describing what is best be described as a pair of shoes, or fixed product file folders, or something like that, it does very good at those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t do good at tone and colloquial mannerisms. But other than that, it&#8217;s pretty good. The AI translations are getting so good. And the cost to review them. So I was once on a project years ago, and this is before this. They built an app, then they sent it to a translation company with no context, so it didn&#8217;t say what was on the page. So there&#8217;s this wonderful place in the world called Turkey. There&#8217;s also a wonderful piece of food from a bird called turkey. And so here you are with the word Turkey, the country, or turkey, the meat, being all across your website. So even humans without context get it wrong. And so you really need that context engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have this wonderful thing in most websites called the back button, we do that. We also as humans have a part of our body called the back. So in other languages, those aren&#8217;t the same word. And those type of things, humans get wrong so often because they just see the word back, and they just see the, most translation tools that send them over to the company to even manually do it, they do it one word at a time. One line at a time. And there&#8217;s no context, so they&#8217;re just like, I guess it means the country, it&#8217;s capital, I guess we&#8217;re not talking about food, but it was a recipe guide and it&#8217;s your turkey dinner. And so those are the type of things that even humans get wrong still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the management of it, back to developer friendly. Could you imagine getting emailed a spreadsheet every week as you&#8217;re trying to go to prod? You&#8217;re building a website, here you are, new post, new blog, new product. Okay, I got to email, and I got to check my email, and then I got to save it on that one, and I gotta create a new one, and then I got to save it again because, oh no, I changed the description, now I have to go back to the translator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in your native language, every keystroke, comma, everything matters. So the human translate, I got to go back, and now I have an entire workflow added to my post and pages. And I love my post and pages, I just want to go in and type and hit save. I barely want somebody else to review it. This is WordPress, we&#8217;re cowboys, we go right to prod. We hit save, we hit publish, we hit draft for a little bit, but we&#8217;re going to prod. And that&#8217;s the difference with these older systems and how to do this is that. With humans involved, you either have to have a huge team or you have to do it yourself, and it still impacts your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real problem with translations is it&#8217;s so time consuming. It&#8217;s so much effort. We thankfully have a connected enough world that we can find a chain between every language on Earth. We can find a person who speaks English to French, we can find a French person who speaks German, we can find a German person who speaks Polish, and we can connect the whole world, great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s got to get much faster, and we have to connect the world. If we could talk to each other like this, this is where we want to go. This is what I want to do. I want this multi-language, Star Trek had it right. The universal translator built into our ears is the correct technology. Every interface you look at is in your technology, localised to your context. That&#8217;s the vision. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You were talking about a workflow there. The AI presumably is significantly quicker, because if you were to be employing humans to do this, presumably you&#8217;d send an email with the text, wait a little while, maybe a day, or a week, or whatever it may be, and then it comes back, and then you&#8217;ve got to then copy and paste that into the blog post. And I realise that there are WordPress plugins out there that will handle that more or less seamlessly on the back end of your website as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m guessing that AI can handle, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a, I don&#8217;t know, 1500 word article or something, I&#8217;m going to guess, I actually don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m guessing that it could translate that in moments. Be it with all the caveats of how accurate it is and what have you. It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward amount of time, so that you could see the results in seconds. Is that accurate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, as a software architect, I can no longer abide by anything longer than three seconds. So our average response time is 1.2 seconds, over at FluentC, and then we are trying to see if we can get that down. That seems too slow to me. And so 1.2 seconds for a whole article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you translate multiple languages simultaneously? Maybe on the FluentC backend, it&#8217;s actually queuing them and doing them one at a time. But would I be able to, for example, say, okay, my target audience is the Chinese market, the Japanese market, the Philippines market, throw in, I don&#8217;t know, Vietnamese and a bunch of other things, you know, languages that I&#8217;m really not that familiar with. Can I get the same result? 1.2 seconds later or thereabouts, they will all be taken care of and ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:30] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s phenomenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:32] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, we built a multithreaded. We have different channels for each language, and basically you can hit 140 languages, don&#8217;t do it, you don&#8217;t need some of these languages. Some of these are like, we&#8217;re thinking about adding Klingon and Kardashian, we&#8217;re talking about mythical languages. If you&#8217;d like to speak Elfish from Lord of the Rings, we&#8217;re working on that too. We do parallel processing. So we handle all of them in about 1.2 seconds. So in about one second, two seconds, you&#8217;ll be able to have all 40 languages, five languages, downloaded to your copy of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that ChatGPT, which is the one I think most people are familiar with, you mentioned that that is not quite as robust for the language translation. What is the difference then between the one that you are using? What is that one called, and how is that different? Is it just purely built to do the job of translating one language to another?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so the regular ChatGPT, the Llama, they&#8217;re only fed documents in certain languages. And they can read, they&#8217;re fed French documents, it&#8217;s all about access to data. This is why we have an accidental bias in AI. We&#8217;re only feeding it English content and, you know, we&#8217;ll say Western languages because that&#8217;s all we have access to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have very limited documentation written in Swahili. There are very few books. There are very few books in Hebrew. The Arabic books do not have the wealth of digital knowledge. There are so many books in Arabic that are not digital. They&#8217;re handwritten books, they&#8217;re handwritten things from historical precedents. But every book written by Charles Dickens is online. Almost everything written in the King&#8217;s English, every bit of Shakespeare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some of these other cultures do not have the digital free access for these AI companies to ingest. And their models, their tokenisation, their transformers, all of that stuff on their side is not designed to go from token to language, it&#8217;s designed to go from token to token. So you need a specific large language model, and a neural net just tied to multilanguage. So Google Translate, DeepL, AWS Translate, those are the big players in the game. And then what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a layer on top of them. And we&#8217;ve built the FluentC LLM to be context driven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of translating one word, we&#8217;re sending in FluentC context. So because we&#8217;re connected to your WordPress site, we know all of your pages. We know all of your about. We know your tagline. We know your title. We know all of that stuff about your site, and we can include that, and we process the context to make sure we have the context right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we do a scoring algorithm across the big cloud translation engines to really drive a good output. So we&#8217;ll know if it&#8217;s a bad translation. And then, you know, we&#8217;ve just recently launched an edit capability, so if you do notice, you can just go in and hit edit, and change. But yeah, the ChatGPTs do terrible translations, and it&#8217;s just not designed for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So when this podcast episode airs, I will use an AI, and we&#8217;re both speaking in English, and it&#8217;s pretty good with the UK accent that I have, and I have no doubt that it will be excellent on the accent that you have. So I will feed the audio into that, and within a minute, less than a minute, it will have transcribed that audio. And it will have done, to my eye, about 95, somewhere between 95 and 97% accurate. There&#8217;s always little bits, for example, it&#8217;ll just mishear the slur between one word and another, and so it&#8217;ll misunderstand that word, but it&#8217;ll do a pretty good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about that is, it&#8217;s just trying to do one word at a time, you know, discreetly. What&#8217;s that word? What&#8217;s that word? What&#8217;s that word? But then if I was to get that translated, let&#8217;s say, into another language, French, German, whatever we pick. When I&#8217;ve had the opportunity live to use Google Translate, it&#8217;s kind of interesting watching that happen because on the screen as I&#8217;m saying English, I&#8217;ll see the Italian words being printed out, and then there&#8217;ll be like a little pause, and things sometimes get deleted in real time. And so somehow it&#8217;s thinking, okay, that word wasn&#8217;t what I thought it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m trying to say is, when it&#8217;s translating, it&#8217;s not taking one word strictly at a time, because that would just be junk. We know that the order of French sentences, for example, is entirely different. They put words before other words and so on. The order in English is completely different to the order in French. Presumably you have to take that into account. So it&#8217;s not just, if we were to watch this happening, it&#8217;s not linear. It must take the whole sentence as a whole, and then have a guess, and then rewrite its guess. How does that all work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:49] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, and it works by, the more you give it, the better it is. So a one word translation, turkey, meat, country, in English. But if you give it a paragraph, and you start talking about a city in Turkey, and you start talking about a neighborhood, and you give it context. You have to have context of everything else you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word, a phrase, you&#8217;re at a bar versus you&#8217;re at church. You&#8217;re at your doctor&#8217;s office versus just walking down the street. Those are contextual elements you have to give to those models so they know who you&#8217;re talking to. If you put relationships between two people, a producer and a customer, a transaction. Or a mother and a daughter. Those are different contexts, and they&#8217;re going to speak differently to each other. And you have to feed all of that in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where pre-processing translations is a really important thing. The Google Translate on Chrome does a great job, it just doesn&#8217;t have all the context. But the context of translations is key. Where we&#8217;re talking, why we&#8217;re talking, when we&#8217;re talking, those are all different things in every language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, do you have a plugin which is linking up to your SaaS backend to do this? And how does that interface with, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say the block editor. How do I, for example, if I created just a post, or a page, or something like that, how does it all look? Do you have a version on the repo, or is this just a premium thing? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Oh yeah, the FluentC plugin is on wordpress.org, and that was a big challenge for me. Coming back to the community, I was unaware that there were standards, and that took a few months. I didn&#8217;t know comments had to end in a period. That was a long-term feedback in my first publication, I&#8217;d go a week and then I&#8217;d have comments wrong. It&#8217;s like, okay then, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s critical to the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the FluentC plugin works in the background. Every time you post or publish anything, we pick it up, and then on that traffic we then store the translation locally to your copy of WordPress without object duplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that, being in WordPress so long, WPML and Polylang have been running the game for, I don&#8217;t know, since the beginning. And the object duplication was always a problem to me. I can&#8217;t grow WordPress to enterprise scale if I have a German version of the page and an English version of the page, I can&#8217;t integrate that content. If I have an e-commerce flow, we talked to some people, and I have a backend not in WordPress, and I&#8217;m feeding WordPress and Woo in my front end, I can&#8217;t have five copies of the same product. I can&#8217;t have object duplication. I need product number seven, I need all my backend systems to go to number seven, I can&#8217;t have a different order ID and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we really built the plugin to solve that problem. And the FluentC plugin, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org, and you just download it, install it, sign up, pick your languages. We&#8217;re giving away a free language still, so there&#8217;s one free language out of the gate, and then you can add and subscribe to more of those, though one language is free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let&#8217;s say, for example, I&#8217;ve got a product with an ID of seven, and I want that product to have five languages. We don&#8217;t need to get into which ones, but five languages. Is the product ID for all of those seven? You are saying, does that differ from other solutions that may be out there? And we&#8217;re not going to get into the competitive differences and what have you but, is there, a difference there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the options that are available, they might create different IDs because they&#8217;ll have the German one, and the Spanish one, and what have you. Whereas you are saying, it&#8217;s all handled in ID of seven. And if that is the case, how does it do the translation? How does it pull out the English text and swap it for the German on the fly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yes, thankfully the fantastic developers in the community at WordPress has given us hooks. And so as the hooks render the front end, and as they&#8217;re done, we intercept the hooks, we run some processing on it, and then we store up right before it&#8217;s viewed. So we have tricked WordPress into thinking there&#8217;s a German page. We have modified the URL, so it&#8217;ll be dash de, and then it&#8217;ll be the product name. And so we have tricked WordPress using hooks and standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor is super fun. That was super fun to get that all integrated. Because for most of the cases, we found that most people actually don&#8217;t speak Japanese. Most English producers of content do not speak Japanese, so they don&#8217;t want to be bothered by it. And then as you go through that workflow, what always bothers me is anything that gets in the way of publishing. We&#8217;re independent free thinkers, we&#8217;re self publishers, right? The whole goal of WordPress is independent publishing, right? It was originally a blogging platform, and it was meant for us to get our word out there and communicate in an internet that didn&#8217;t support it. But FluentC plugin is designed to be seamless, and if you want to control it, you can. But other than that, you just ignore it. And I hope you just go to my app and hit subscribe, and then you never touch it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you, on the backend, how do you see, are you able to see the German translation? Does it sort of store the German in a meta field somewhere, or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:33] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, actually we just published it yesterday, that you&#8217;re actually able to, as of yesterday, go in and see all of the translations. We use transients, and so we&#8217;re using transients in the WordPress database, and it&#8217;s super fast because you never hit my cloud. Once it comes a way back to you during that initial load, that 1.3 seconds per page thing like that, then it&#8217;s right from your page, and right from your server. You don&#8217;t call back. You&#8217;re not dependent on me after you get the translation, so it&#8217;s super fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a software architect, I&#8217;ve been doing that for 20 years, performance is key. If we slow down all of WordPress because we want to support more people, that&#8217;s counterproductive. We can&#8217;t add billions of new people to our sites and then, oh yeah, everyone&#8217;s now one and a half, two seconds slower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t know how closely you keep your eye on the roadmap for WordPress, but we&#8217;re in phase three of the Gutenberg project. And at the moment that, broadly speaking, could be categorised as collaboration. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of other things thrown in there as well, but the idea of having some interface which we can communicate with in real time with other people, and that&#8217;s yet to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fourth phase is all about this topic, is all about multilingual and what have you. And I imagine that there is an opportunity there, but also maybe there&#8217;s a little bit of trepidation. Because, although the scope for this phase four hasn&#8217;t been exactly ironed out really, and there&#8217;s a little bit up in the air because we haven&#8217;t got there yet. I don&#8217;t know what your thoughts are, whether or not you are building a business which may end up being completely upended by WordPress Core. Or whether you think actually there&#8217;s a opportunity for me here because I&#8217;ll be able to bolt into whatever is built. So that question is, it&#8217;s not very targeted, but hopefully you&#8217;ve got an intuition. Phase four is coming, it&#8217;s going to be exactly in the ballpark of what you are doing. So does it offer you an opportunity, or is it something to be worried about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:24] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> We are looking forward to participating in phase four. Now that I&#8217;m actively in the community, I&#8217;d love to help with phase four. We are dreaming of a world where you just use FluentC&#8217;s backend, you don&#8217;t need to install our plugin, be fantastic. If we could get standardisation among the hooks, the translations, the power to do it and edit it, that would be fantastic. We view all of the phase four talk as a super impactful, important upgrade to WordPress, to make it really global publishing software,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in that scenario, perhaps the intention for you is to pivot away from being a plugin, more to being an API basically. You know, you go to your service in the same way that you do for ChatGPT, for example, and you get a key. And you paste that into some core component of WordPress, which ships with vanilla WordPress, and then your translation has just happened on the fly. That&#8217;s interesting. So that&#8217;s a potential direction you are hoping it might go in, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that would be great. If we end up that WordPress does it so well that all of the translation plugins are irrelevant, and now we&#8217;re competing on API qualities, I&#8217;m perfectly fine with that. I&#8217;m perfectly fine with building a better mousetrap and helping WordPress. Honestly, I just want the world to get smaller and make this easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we&#8217;re going to do fine in that world. I think we&#8217;re going to be proactive, I think the developer tools we&#8217;re coming out with in the next few months, to actually automatically get all of your language files ready to go, and at least one version of translation ready to submit with your plugin, will make the world smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think having multi-language themes with 1.2 second response time is pretty good, so that theme developers can start to plug in. We think there&#8217;s still an area around WordPress that&#8217;ll make it better, and then if WordPress can standardise the way it thinks about multi-language, standardise the control mechanisms. We&#8217;ve had to invent a lot of stuff that, once it&#8217;s standardises we think it&#8217;ll be better for everyone. And yes, it will allow more up market entrants, and yes, it will be more open, but that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s the nature of the LLMs? I know that you drew a distinction between the LLMs that you&#8217;ve decided to use and the layer that you&#8217;ve added on top, and the ones that we&#8217;re all familiar with, ChatGPT and what have you. What I&#8217;m meaning by this is that it feels like a lot of money, in many cases, tens of billions of dollars is pointing towards things like ChatGPT. And we know that Google has deep products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are we worried about a future where only a few of these AI companies are able to offer services? Simply because they&#8217;ve been the ones that have invested so much, and they&#8217;ve become the defaults. Does anything like that concern you at all? That we&#8217;re sort of building something where there&#8217;s going to be a few incumbents, and their AI is going to be so superior to anything else, that we won&#8217;t have an opportunity to use rivals, because they just won&#8217;t be worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s all around tech though. We have our big six tech firms, they have more money than anyone thought they should have. They have so much power, they have so much control. They could buy all of the competitors in the entire space for less than they lost buying coffee. And that consolidation, that&#8217;s going to be a real problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There almost has to be a WordPress for AI. We have to get an open source AI model that actually is contributed by other people. We have to do, maybe Matt wants to start another thing. And we have to go at this because WordPress and this open source, it serves a real valid purpose. It does keep everyone in check, it does keep everyone in line. The reason it&#8217;s not $25,000 to run out a basic website is because WordPress exists. Self-publishing, open source tools exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the AI goes private, we&#8217;ll call it 1980s versions of software. The eighties existed, we&#8217;ve already seen this. We&#8217;ve seen languages, coding languages that were proprietary. Software that&#8217;s proprietary. We have Java. We know how this goes. We have Objective-C. We have whole languages locked down by a company. If they lock down the AI, we&#8217;re all not going to be able to use it unless we pay them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is not a competitive landscape. We need that openness, we need the WordPress people to really get involved in this because it&#8217;s going to be out of our control, and it&#8217;s going to get self consolidated. It&#8217;s how capitalism works. The market drive to a single winner. It drives unless there are other values than money, and people who see other value, community value, network value, people that actually just want to win and communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all of this stuff that we get out of WordPress, all of the joy and happiness. We were so happy, I was just at WordCamp Ottawa. It was such a happy place. We&#8217;re all just there to learn, and talk, and teach, and do, and be together, and it&#8217;s so fantastic. And I really love that about WordPress, and we do need that for AI because it is going to get controlled by these mega companies. I mean, Microsoft spent $10 billion, yeah, billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> My understanding is that they&#8217;re potentially also building a $100 billion data center in the very near future as well. You know, just eye watering amounts of money that the likes of you and I, really it&#8217;s difficult to understand the levels that these companies are on. And you imagine that, the more that they can pour into it, the more that they pull ahead in the race, and make themselves so indispensable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually that leads me to another, and probably final question. If you are in the technology space, for the last 50 years, it&#8217;s been a tough thing to keep up because technology changes so fast, but some things don&#8217;t change too quickly. Like the CSS spec doesn&#8217;t change all that quickly. So you&#8217;re building, I don&#8217;t know, a page builder, you&#8217;ve at least got a bedrock there and you can work on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is this for you, in the AI space, trying to keep up? Because it feels like, you know, you blink and things have changed. From one day to the next, something that was working is no longer working. Something which was cool is no longer cool. Some company that you&#8217;d never heard of is now worth a hundred billion dollars, you know. How do you keep up with all of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:18] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so we focus on things that I personally, and our company, focus on value. We do not respect this slideware, vaporware version of AI. We have lived through blockchain. We have lived through Web 2.0. I have been doing this for 25 years. I had an AOL disc, I used to use dial up internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are driving to things that actually create value. And those things we&#8217;re chasing, duplicating, replicating, incorporating. And we&#8217;ve gotten good at identifying the stuff that&#8217;s just fluff. And that&#8217;s going to be hard for new people to come in in tech, that they can&#8217;t identify it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we were here through all of this. Like we have been here since containers, when containerisation was going to change the world. And it sort of did, but it sort of didn&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s now just on the tool belt, and it&#8217;s another button in the servers. But it&#8217;s not really, it didn&#8217;t change the world, it didn&#8217;t solve everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it kind of feels to me that, I really don&#8217;t know, I think you could almost flip a coin and see whether AI will be used everywhere, or the opposite. You know, people will just get fed up with it and think, actually, do you know what, the human touch is much better. But it does feel like you are on fairly steady ground because the capacity for AI to do the translation job is so profoundly obvious. It&#8217;s really straightforward. There&#8217;s a direct line between, I don&#8217;t know, the amount of time that it takes and the cost, and what have you. It really seems like a really sensible place to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re kind of going to have to knock it on the head because of the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got available for this podcast. But just before we go, would you mind just dropping a few details about where people can find you? That could be, I don&#8217;t know, a social handle, it could be a website, or an email. What&#8217;s the best place to find you if people want to talk about translating in WordPress with AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:56] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m on the Make WordPress Slack. Our website FluentC.ai is our WordPress focus website, F-L-U-E-N-T-C dot A-I, is our WordPress focus website. That&#8217;s a great place. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. But Slack and wordpress.org are great places to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:16] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias has extensive experience in the technology and creative sectors, and is currently working as the co-founder of FluentC.ai, an AI-powered language technology company. With a background in technology, he’s focusing on developing solutions to enhance communication across different languages and platforms. He’s been involved with WordPress since its early days around version 1.2, and has a rich history of web design and consulting, having worked on hundreds of WordPress websites. But it’s only recently that he’s become more engaged in the WordPress community through events like WordCamp Buffalo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast today we talk about AI-driven language translations, particularly focusing on Matthias’s work with FluentC, which is his translation plugin for WordPress. It supports multithreaded, simultaneous translations of up to 140 languages, enabling your pages and posts to be offered in other languages in just a few moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover the differences between AI models designed for translation, such as ChatGPT and Llama, which aren&#8217;t specialised for this task, and how his platform builds a contextual layer above those. He emphasises the importance of context and diverse multilingual data in producing high-quality translations. FluentC&#8217;s functionality involves local storage of translated content, in an effort to maintain website speed. This is done using native WordPress hooks and URL modifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias also offers his thoughts on the ongoing multilingual support phase of the Gutenberg project, and his hopes for FluentC to evolve from a standalone plugin to an API which could be used by WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the broader implications of AI in translation, the need for open-source models to compete in this rapidly evolving space, and the parallels between AI evolution and past trends like blockchain and Web 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the intersection of AI and WordPress, or are looking to enhance your website&#8217;s multilingual capabilities, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fluentc.ai/\">FluentC website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentc-translation/\">FluentC plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://llama.meta.com/\">Llama</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=translate\">Google Translate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\">DeepL</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/translate/\">AWS Translate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpml.org/\">WPML plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\">Polylang plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mvpis/\">Matthias on WordPress.org</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: How to Stop Contact Form Spam on Any Website (99.99% Accuracy)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19881:\"<p>If you have an unsecured contact form on your website —&nbsp;one that doesn’t use any kind of spam-prevention technology —&nbsp;you’ll likely get a lot of time-wasting, irrelevant submissions.

We’ll explain how each solution works, as well as its pros and cons, to help you decide which option to implement for your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1095\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Over 100 million websites use Akismet to protect against form spam. Once you set up Akismet on your site, it will analyze submissions and determine what is real content and what is&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet leverages machine learning to do this. The software has removed over 500 billion pieces of spam from the web. Every time it does this, it gets better at identifying spam. It’s gotten so good, in fact, that it boasts an accuracy rating of&nbsp;99.99%.</p>\n\n<p>The best thing about Akismet is that it doesn’t force users to solve puzzles or interact with elements on your site before enabling them to submit a form. Akismet does its work in the background and prevents contact form spam from reaching your&nbsp;inbox.</p>\n\n<p>If you use WordPress, you can easily integrate Akismet <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">with a plugin</a>. Akismet also offers integration options for other content management systems (CMS), including <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/getting-started/does-akismet-only-work-with-wordpress/#:~:text=While%20Akismet%20is%20most%20used,the%20Plugins%20and%20libraries%20page.\">Joomla and&nbsp;Drupal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also integrate Akismet with other types of sites using its API. This makes it a near&#8209;universal solution for spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-captchas\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. CAPTCHAs</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"939\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of reCAPTCHA on a form\" class=\"wp-image-284165\" />\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-captcha/\">Completely automated public Turing tests (or CAPTCHAs)</a> are tools designed to help block bots from being able to submit forms. CAPTCHAs are everywhere on the web, from login pages to comment sections and contact&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n<p>There are several types of CAPTCHAs you can use to protect a contact form. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-recaptcha/\">Google reCAPTCHA</a>, for example, provides CAPTCHAs with visual puzzles that users need to solve or elements they need to click on to prove they’re human. The latest versions of reCAPTCHA don’t require interaction, but you’re free to choose which option to&nbsp;use.</p>\n\n<p>While CAPTCHAs are popular, they do have a few downsides. We’ll explore the cons of using CAPTCHAs later in the&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-honeypot\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Honeypot</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-honeypot/\">Using honeypots</a> is a creative way to mitigate contact form spam for a website. This method involves setting up an input field within the form and hiding it from human users in some way (typically using&nbsp;CSS).</p>\n\n<p>Although real visitors won’t be able to see the field, they’ll still be able to submit forms as usual. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-spambot/\">Spambots</a>, on the other hand, are typically configured to fill out every field in a form, including&nbsp;honeypots.</p>\n\n<p>This method can help you identify which form submissions come from bots. You can use that information to filter these messages and keep your focus on real&nbsp;submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Although the honeypot approach can be effective, you’ll still receive contact form spam, which can clutter your inbox. Plus, you’ll need to understand basic CSS to hide a contact form field. If you use a CMS with a contact form plugin, it might not allow you to easily hide&nbsp;elements.</p>\n\n<p>Some spambots are also capable of bypassing honeypot fields. And, you run the risk of real users stumbling into the hidden fields, which can lead you to think their submissions are also&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-session cookies\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Session&nbsp;cookies</h3>\n\n<p>As you may know, some websites use session cookies to track your information and activity on their pages. This means you can also use cookies to identify bots due to the way they behave on your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>Bot activity can be relatively simple to identify. Spambots often go straight for contact forms, fill them out immediately, and attempt to make multiple submissions. In contrast to how real users behave, they’re also unlikely to interact with other elements on a&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>You can use this information to block form submissions for sessions that engage in suspicious behavior. But this only works if you’re comfortable configuring cookies to detect suspicious&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<p>That process requires you to configure the cookies to flag behavior that you would typically see with spambots. There can be a lot of trial and error involved in this process, and it’s arguably a lot more difficult than using an available tool or service to block contact form&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, this solution is more common among enterprise websites and businesses that have the technical know&#8209;how to implement advanced security measures. Even then, the results you get might not be worth the trouble when there are out&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;box solutions you can use to achieve similar (or even better)&nbsp;results.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-email filtering\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Email&nbsp;filtering</h3>\n\n<p>Most modern email clients offer some type of message filtering functionality. You can use these filters to flag emails from specific addresses or those that contain keywords you associate with&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1263\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png\" alt=\"filters and blocked addresses section of Gmail\" class=\"wp-image-284167\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In general, you shouldn’t use email filtering tools to deal with contact form spam unless you get a very low number of messages. For this method to be effective, you need to decide what terms to filter and continue to add new keywords over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Flagging the wrong keywords can lead to situations where your email will falsely flag messages from real users. Identifying these false positives will often require you to spend time in your email’s spam folder, which is precisely what you want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-captcha-is-not-the-best option\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why CAPTCHA is not the best&nbsp;option</h2>\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs are one of the most common forms of spam protection on the web. You can see CAPTCHAs everywhere, but that doesn’t mean they’re the most effective spam protection method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons why using them may not be the best&nbsp;option:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>CAPTCHAs negatively impact the user experience. </strong>Some types of CAPTCHAs require users to interact with an element to prove they’re human or to solve one or more puzzles. If you’ve ever had to solve multiple CAPTCHA puzzles to access a form, you know how frustrating this can&nbsp;be.</li>\n\n<li><strong>CAPTCHAs are prone to false positives.</strong> Even humans can make mistakes when it comes to CAPTCHAs. The detection algorithms aren’t perfect, which can lead to situations where a website flags a real user as a bot and prevents them from submitting a contact&nbsp;form.</li>\n\n<li><strong>CAPTCHAs require work to set up and constant updates. </strong>Spambots and CAPTCHAs are constantly trying to beat each other. Some types of spambots can bypass CAPTCHAs with a decent success rate. This means you may need to update your CAPTCHA implementation regularly. Plus, you have to set up CAPTCHAs individually for each form you want to&nbsp;protect.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that your experience using CAPTCHAs can vary a lot depending on which service you use. Some CAPTCHAs, like the latest versions of reCAPTCHA, don’t require users to solve puzzles or interact with elements on the web. Even so, it’s safe to say that CAPTCHAs are becoming&nbsp;outdated.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of using a CAPTCHA, consider a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">more powerful alternative</a> to the contact form spam problem, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: the best anti&#8209;spam&nbsp;solution</h2>\n\n\n<p>Most anti-spam tools focus on identifying spam content and bots before they can submit a contact form. Akismet does things differently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service uses machine learning to constantly improve its spam detection capabilities. That constant improvement has led to the point where Akismet can boast a 99.99% accuracy rate in detecting spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can choose whether to save spam comments for review or let Akismet discard them&nbsp;immediately.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"918\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png\" alt=\"spam filtering settings in Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-284169\" />\n\n\n<p>Akismet will automatically detect contact form spam and filter it for you. The service also offers a host of other benefits, which include the&nbsp;following:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Easy setup. </strong>If you use WordPress, you can set up Akismet in minutes. All you have to do is install and activate the plugin, and it will automatically start protecting your site against spam submissions. This ease of use also applies to installing Akismet on other types of&nbsp;sites.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A more seamless user experience. </strong>The service works in the background and doesn’t involve elements that require user interaction. This reduces the friction of submitting a contact form, which can improve your conversion&nbsp;rates.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Integration with any kind of website. </strong>Akismet offers simple integration protocols for several popular platforms, including WordPress. You can also use the Akismet API to make the service work with nearly any other kind of website or&nbsp;application.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that if you want to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/getting-started/\">use the Akismet API</a>, you’ll probably need to work with a developer to set up a custom integration for your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-integrate-akismet-on-any website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to integrate Akismet on any&nbsp;website</h2>\n\n<p>Akismet offers different integration methods depending on what kind of website you run. If you’re using WordPress, you can get Akismet up and running in a matter of&nbsp;minutes.</p>\n\n\n<p>To start, install and activate the Akismet plugin. Then, Akismet will ask you to select a plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Hobbyists can select a <strong>Personal </strong>plan and pay a fair rate of their choice. Incredibly affordable commercial plans are available for other&nbsp;situations.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"865\" height=\"835\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-4.png\" alt=\"pricing plans for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-284170\" />\n\n\n<p>Once you sign up for a plan, you’ll get access to an Akismet API key. Enter that key in WordPress by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet&nbsp;Anti&#8209;Spam</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png\" alt=\"entering your API key in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-284171\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Click on <strong>Connect with API key </strong>and that’s it. Akismet will activate and start protecting your site from spam immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Note that if you’re using Akismet with WordPress, the plugin integrates with some of the most popular contact form tools. That includes options like Jetpack’s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/contact-form/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">form blocks</a>, Contact Form 7, and Gravity&nbsp;Forms.</p>\n\n<p>As we mentioned before, Akismet also offers <a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/plugins-and-libraries/\">integrations with other CMSs</a>, including Joomla and Drupal. Those integrations work differently than with WordPress, so you’ll need to check the Akismet documentation to set them&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n<p>You also have the option of <a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/\">using the Akismet API</a> to integrate the service with any kind of website or application. This requires some level of development work, but enables you to leverage Akismet’s spam detection and protection functionality on any<strong>&nbsp;</strong>website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>If you still have questions about how to stop spam from website contact forms, this section will answer&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-contact-form spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is contact form&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Contact forms are common targets for spammers and bots. If the form doesn’t use some type of security feature, spammers are able to make all kinds of useless and potentially&#8209;harmful submissions through the form. These can include links to other websites, promotions for fraudulent services and products, and automatically&#8209;generated&nbsp;content.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-contact-form-spam-affect-a website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does contact form spam affect a&nbsp;website?</h3>\n\n<p>Contact form spam shouldn’t affect your website on the front end, unless the form is open to some kind of attack that can compromise your site’s security (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/what-is-sql-injection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like SQL&nbsp;injection</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, the biggest downside of contact form spam is having to deal with it. This spam can quickly fill up your inbox and make it harder for you to separate the real messages from the fake&nbsp;ones.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-akismet-considered-the-best-solution-for-contact-form spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Akismet considered the best solution for contact form&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Most solutions that focus on stopping contact form spam do so at the expense of the user experience. CAPTCHAs, for instance, force users to solve problems or click on elements before they can submit a form. This can reduce the number of people willing to use the form and can even make them inaccessible to those with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is highly effective in stopping contact form spam, with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99% for spam content. Plus, Akismet doesn’t impact the user experience whatsoever, as it works in the background during form&nbsp;submission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-honeypot-fields-and-how-do-they work\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are honeypot fields, and how do they&nbsp;work?</h3>\n\n<p>A honeypot field is an element in a contact form that only bots should be able to engage with. You can create one by using CSS to hide a field in plain sight or through a plugin that will handle this for you. Regular users will skip the hidden field, but spambots&nbsp;won’t.</p>\n\n<p>Once the honeypot is set, you can filter all contact form submissions that fill out the field. You may also be able to blocklist the IP addresses that make the submissions, depending on which contact form tool you’re&nbsp;using.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-effective-is-captcha-in-preventing spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How effective is CAPTCHA in preventing&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs are among the most popular solutions for protecting your website from contact form spam. Their popularity makes them a significant target for attackers, who are constantly devising ways to bypass them using automated&nbsp;tools.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also not uncommon for CAPTCHAs to flag real users as bots. Overall, CAPTCHAs can be highly effective, but they’re not without several&nbsp;downsides.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-spambots-bypass-honeypot-fields-and captchas\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can spambots bypass honeypot fields and&nbsp;CAPTCHAs?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, some spambots can bypass honeypot fields and CAPTCHAs. Attackers are constantly trying to bypass form security measures, and that means creating new bots and constantly updating them so they remain&nbsp;effective.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet bypasses this problem by focusing its spam detection tools on the content of the form submissions. The service also learns from each submission, which makes it the most accurate spam detection and prevention tool on the&nbsp;market.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-akismet-protect-against-all-types-of spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can Akismet protect against all types of&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers and bots tend to target any public form on websites. Akismet can protect all the forms on your site by monitoring submissions. It does this without you having to set up individual protection for each form, as is the case with&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>You can visit the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet features page</a> to learn more about how its spam protection functionality works.

Hi, my name is Adam Weeks, and this is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Hi, I&#8217;m Emma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Hey, Emma! Oh my goodness, it&#8217;s been a little while. We&#8217;re getting to catch up, and have we got a show for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh, do we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yes, yes, yes! This is Woo Biz Chat. This conversation came about because I was thinking of this topic, and I don’t know that we’ve really talked about it much. However, I have a new contract, and I’ve been working with 10up. 10up is one of the biggest agencies in WordPress, and they’ve grown so much because they do certain things really well. I’ve been so impressed with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I hear repeatedly is about that &#8220;last 10%.&#8221; That’s really what gets them over the finish line with some of these big enterprise projects. It’s been a lot of fun getting to know this talented team. One of the people on this team, her name is Haley, and she is hilarious. She’s a project manager and very good at communicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, this morning I hopped on Slack, as you do, and she had a very succinct but thorough rundown of an event we needed to be updated on. She did it in a way that was clear, funny, interesting, and timely. So, let’s talk about a few of those things we’re going to discuss in this episode. If you’re curious about asynchronous communication, this might be something unique—not to commerce so much—but in Woo, I imagine we have to work asynchronously. We’re in our Slack, we’re in our email, and we need to have a good foundation and a good way to communicate asynchronously. We’re going to dive into all those topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we start, is it okay to swear? When can you be funny? When can you not? All these things—so that’s what we’re going to get into. Also, Emma, one of the reasons we picked this topic is that you are very good at it, and I’m going to learn from you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Except for all of…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Let’s start us off. Tell me your general thoughts on asynchronous communication. Do you have a philosophy? What are your thoughts from a high level?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />That&#8217;s such a loaded question! It&#8217;s like, how do you pack everything into one nicely typed-out message as a response?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />It really is. Practice doesn’t make perfect, but it gets close. And everybody’s different. One thing we can start off with is that there are so many different audiences, and people know you at different levels, so everyone will interpret communication differently. But just to quickly start off, for people who don’t know—what even is async communication? Basically, it&#8217;s communication where the participants don’t need to interact in real-time. It doesn’t have to be face-to-face. It can be messages or information exchanged on Slack, Messenger, Teams, project management tools, emails, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is different from synchronous communication, which is what we’re doing now—calls, meetings, phone calls, live chat, stuff like that. Asynchronous communication is when a message is sent, and you deal with it when you can. So, what are the best ways to deal with it from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Alright, asynchronous communication. We use it a lot in this industry because of the nature of the work. Time zones are another reason for async communication. Your day might not overlap with your coworkers or clients completely. It can be helpful to get something moving, and then when you go to sleep, someone else is waking up and takes it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, I’m going to ask you a few different questions. You’re good at this! What is one thing you try to do when using async communication? What’s a guiding principle for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />It’s actually kind of funny because we communicate like this a lot due to our time zones. Yesterday, I sent you a message before bed like, “Here, check out these show notes,” and then I checked it after your full day. But it wasn’t always that easy. Well, with you, yes, but with other people, maybe not as easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stand by this: over-communicating is never a bad thing when it comes to async communication, especially if the person has never met you before. Whether it&#8217;s a quick “huddle” on Slack or Zoom, if someone’s never put a tone or voice behind your words, they might interpret it in many different ways. So, clarity and context are essential. Sometimes, I reread a message I sent and think, &#8220;I know what that means, but maybe the person reading it doesn’t.&#8221; Over-communicating is never really over-communicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />You are never penalized for over-communicating. The person may be annoyed, but that&#8217;s okay. They can skim it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. One person might say, “I already know all this; why did you write so much?” But maybe 99 other people reading it will go, “Oh, it all makes sense now. I don’t have to ask any follow-up questions.” Amazing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s like taking notes in a meeting. You think, “Oh, I’ll remember that.” Nope, I won’t remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />No way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />My brain doesn’t work that well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />My brain ain’t braining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />My brain ain’t braining! And sometimes, you’re taking notes for someone who wasn’t at the meeting. If someone gets hit by a bus—this sounds terrible—and they weren’t there…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />They’ll have the notes communicated async. Just kidding! Because they’re…dead. No, wait, sorry. Too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Asynchronous communication. What was I saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />You were talking about taking notes for someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Right, your notes need to stand on their own for someone who doesn’t have any context. You won’t be penalized for over-communicating, and the person you&#8217;re communicating with might also be forgetful. You won’t be penalized for clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />A hundred percent. But in addition, I’d recommend—depending on the type of communication—if you can, jump on a short call. Putting a voice behind the words they’ll read on a screen helps, especially if it’s the first time you’re giving feedback. You don’t have to do this every time, but I recently did this at work. I was in a call with some team leads, hosting a meeting. I can’t remember all the details, but at the end, they asked for feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d never given this person feedback in written form before, and I made sure there was enough context, examples, and action points in the message. But then I thought, “You could read this the wrong way.” So I said, “Hey, can you hop on a quick call? I’ll send this feedback afterward.” It was just a quick Slack huddle. After that, the next time I sent feedback, it was clear, and I didn’t need to overuse emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure! Here’s the continuation of the corrected transcript:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Wait, wait…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />You couldn’t see me, but I also did cat claws, like &#8220;rawr.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Everyone&#8217;s imagining that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I thought, &#8220;She asked for feedback, so let me jump on a quick call to give it to her.&#8221; After that, when I sent the written feedback, it was very clear. She could now imagine my personality behind the words, without me having to overuse emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Oh, all the emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So you bring up a good point. We’re talking about asynchronous communication and how to use it, but there’s also the point of <em>when not</em> to use it. I’ve come up with this framework: information is shared quite well asynchronously—whether through emails or Slack—but if you’re trying to connect with someone, solve a problem, or if there’s some emotional element involved, it’s better to hop on a quick Zoom call, or use Slack’s huddle feature. Sometimes something that might take back-and-forth exchanges in Slack—or even be misunderstood—can be solved in two minutes over a call. Don’t try to solve problems over a text message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree. If there’s no quick decision being made or communication is being lost due to a lack of context, then move to another method. Whether it’s a call, a huddle, or a voice note—even a quick voice recording can help bridge the gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Oh yeah, voice notes are great. You can record a quick message. Another thing I don’t use enough is video recording—where you record your screen and say, &#8220;Hey, this is what I’m seeing.&#8221; They can hear your voice and see exactly what you&#8217;re seeing, which can be super helpful. So, there are lots of ways to handle async communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so we briefly talked about emojis—emoticons? I don’t know the difference. How do you use them? When do you find them helpful, or when are they annoying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />One of the things I love about working with Hosting or switching to different Slack groups is the custom emojis they have. They’ve got all these little dancing characters. When I move to WordPress Slack, or back to our group, I’m like, “Where’s the dancing cookie?” or “Where’s the cat spinning on a Roomba?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221; of my own custom emojis, like Emma smirking, Emma flabbergasted, Emma disappointed. And I’m sad when I go to Messenger or another platform that doesn’t let me use them. Sometimes, all you need is an emoji to express yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Okay, wait—Bob, if you’re listening, we need to get all of Emma’s custom emojis on Slack. I want them all!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, I think I can make them myself. We’ll have to see. But we kind of have this weird thing where the original smiley face—the one with no teeth—has turned into this passive-aggressive emoji for some reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />The thumbs-up emoji—is that okay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh yeah, thumbs-up is okay. We kind of use it as the end of a conversation, like, “This is done. No need to continue.” It’s like when you’re dating and don’t know how to hang up the phone—you hang up first, no, you hang up first. Someone sends a thumbs-up, and that’s it. It’s all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s all Gucci! What about the hands-raised emoji? You know, the two hands in the air?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, we use that one a lot, along with the &#8220;grinning&#8221; emoji, which is like, “Oops, we’ve got to work on that now.” And of course, the sweating smile when something doesn’t go as planned. The shrug emoji is also a big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />I love the shrug emoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh, totally. It adds a little bit of emotion to your communication. Sometimes, just a simple emoji makes the message more relatable—especially if you’re trying to send kudos or hype someone up. But don’t go overboard with emojis either, because then it can distract from the actual message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Too much emotion, not enough content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. And on that note, there are some emojis that don’t age well or might accidentally offend someone. Sometimes an emoji or symbol might become controversial or inappropriate, and then someone calls you out on it. If it wasn’t malicious, just delete it and learn from it. There are boundaries to emoji usage, but they can be a fun and helpful tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, the takeaway here is: use emojis, but don’t overdo it. They’re helpful in adding some humanity to otherwise black-and-white text. You can only use so many exclamation marks. Do you use exclamation marks a lot to add emphasis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I have this weird thing against exclamation marks. Stop shouting at me! Nobody’s that excited. I tend to avoid using too many. However, I’ve caught myself doing it when I’m really excited. Someone once gave me feedback about that—because I tend to end messages with double periods or double stops, like &#8220;..&#8221; instead of a single period or an ellipsis. They said that it could come across as unhappy or cold if I didn’t add more information or an emoji. So, I switched that up!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Communication evolves, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yep, if you’re trying to ensure people know you&#8217;re happy or positive, throw in a smiley face or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great point—feedback can be really helpful for improving how you communicate. So, what we take away from this is: give feedback on how someone’s async communication is going, and assume the best in them, especially when you don’t hear back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone doesn’t respond after you’ve put effort into your message—there are crickets—how do you handle that situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, that happens. Especially because my team spans 10 time zones, there’s no way everyone is online at the same time. So, one thing we do is react to messages with an emoji once we&#8217;ve read it or acted on it. Sometimes that gets old, but it becomes second nature—react with a fun emoji so that people know you&#8217;ve seen the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I’m all for tagging people. Not aggressively, but if 24 hours have passed and you know they’ve been online, tag them again. Ping them until they see it! It’s easy to miss a message in Slack or Teams, especially if it pops up briefly and you lose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Exactly. Sometimes you see a message, but then it disappears, and you can’t find it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Right, or if you accidentally open it on your phone, you’re kind of out of luck. So don’t feel bad about tagging people—ping them a few times. From my perspective, I’ve never gotten mad at someone for tagging me multiple times. If I missed it, I appreciate the reminder. You could also use a loading emoji, like “I’m working on it, but give me a minute.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, aggressively tagging—got it. Another thing I’ve found helpful is to avoid asking seven questions in one message. If someone knows the answer to six of them but not the seventh, they might delay responding altogether. Break it down to one or two key questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the continuation of the transcript with corrections:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, break it down into one or two key questions, and when you get that response, they can address those first. When you overload someone with too many questions, they’re more likely to ghost you—not because they mean to, but because it feels overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, when you do get a response, you might see a little checkmark or a “done,” or they might write “received” or “great question, let me follow up.” That’s something I try to do more of—if someone asks me something complex and I don’t have all the answers right away, I at least let them know I’m thinking about it or working on it. It helps keep the conversation moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, that’s important. And if your company already has established procedures, emojis can be helpful for tracking communication, too. You can use a &#8220;loading&#8221; emoji, the eyes emoji, or a “working on it” emoji to show progress, and then update it when you&#8217;re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want to touch on the formatting of async communication. If you need to ask more than three questions, it can get confusing. If you have a multi-part conversation, I recommend sending a separate post for each topic so they can each have their own dedicated thread. That way, less information gets lost compared to a giant message where everything is lumped together. Otherwise, you might end up having to schedule a call because there’s too much going on in one message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great tip. Another thing I picked up from my friend Haley at 10up is the importance of consistency and rhythm in communication. If you’re managing a project and have a weekly meeting or update, try to send your agenda or summary at the same time every week. People appreciate predictability in communication—it helps build trust and reduces surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good tip Haley mentioned was drafting your message in Google Docs and getting peer review before you send it out. What’s your take on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I think it depends on the message, but yeah, I definitely agree with using Google Docs for longer or more formal messages. I’m more comfortable writing in Google Docs because I have Grammarly and other tools to help catch mistakes. Also, if it’s something important or if I need input from others, I’ll ask someone to review it before sending it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, I’ll ask for feedback like, “Does this have enough context? Does this sound like me? Do I sound upset or annoyed?” Having another set of eyes on a message can help make sure it&#8217;s clear and professional before you hit send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, I love Grammarly Pro for the win! It&#8217;s not just about catching grammar mistakes—it’s also about ensuring that the message aligns with what you want to convey. Especially with important messages or anything client-facing, it&#8217;s good to slow down and have someone else review it. Don’t rush to publish it—take a beat, have someone look it over, and make sure everything’s in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one trick I’ve learned is to set expectations upfront. Instead of saying, “When you have a minute, can you look at this?” say, “I need to send this out by 7 PM; would you mind reviewing it before then?” That way, they know how urgent it is, and if they can’t get to it in time, you’re still able to send it by the deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly! And it helps to be clear about expectations, especially in different time zones. Also, if something is optional for some people but mandatory for others, it’s important to tag those people directly so they know they need to review it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had an example today on my team where someone sent a message with a summary and action points, and then said, “You have until the end of the day to challenge this, or I’m proceeding.” That’s a great way to set a clear timeline and let people know what the plan is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great way to handle it—give a clear deadline for feedback and move forward if no one challenges it. There’s a phrase I like: “It’s unkind to be unclear.” Sometimes we try to be too nice, saying, “If you have time,” or “whatever works for you,” but in the end, it just makes things more confusing. Being direct is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree! It’s like when I speak, I tend to say, “Maybe, possibly, kind of…” but in messages, I’m much more direct—“Do this” or “This needs to happen.” It’s about clarity and getting things done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, it’s unkind to be unclear. You want to be kind and polite, but also clear. It’s a balance—don’t leave people guessing, but also don’t be overly harsh. And if you’re giving people a timeline, tell them when you need something done, and if it’s okay if they don’t respond, let them know that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. And when you’re writing these messages, also be aware of the language you use, especially when it comes to different cultures and inclusivity. You don’t want to unintentionally offend someone, so choose your words carefully. And if you do make a mistake, apologize and learn from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yes, that’s a great point—be mindful of your audience and the words you choose. And if you mess up, own it and apologize. We’re all learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, we’ve covered a lot, but we still have one more sensitive topic to discuss: swearing. Is it okay to swear? When is it okay, and when is it not okay? What’s your take on dropping swear words in async communication?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Personally, I have a bit of a potty mouth, so I’m used to swearing in my day-to-day life. But in async communication, it depends on the company culture. At Hostinger, for example, it’s common for people to drop the occasional F-bomb internally, but I wouldn’t swear in a message to someone I just met or on their first day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think swearing is something that comes with familiarity—it’s more about knowing your audience. If it’s internal and you have a good relationship with the person, swearing might be fine. But for external clients or more formal situations, it’s definitely a no-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, I agree. Don’t be the first to swear. If you’re building a relationship or working with a client, keep it professional. There’s a time and place for it, and you want to be sure it’s appropriate before you start using swear words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, you want to be authentic. So if you’re comfortable swearing in certain contexts and it feels natural, it’s okay to do that—but be mindful of the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. Be yourself, but be cautious. And remember, in async communication, everything can be screenshot and shared. So, if you’re swearing in Slack or anywhere else, be aware that it could end up somewhere you didn’t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great point. Always assume your message could be shared, even in private channels or DMs. If you wouldn’t want your message to be forwarded, don’t send it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I try to do in async messages is start by being human. It’s easy to get straight to the point in async communication, but it’s nice to start with a “Hey, how are you?” or “Hope your week is going well” before diving into the business stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree! My greetings change depending on my energy levels. Sometimes it’s “Hey,” sometimes it’s “Hello!” with lots of o’s, or even a dancing cactus emoji. But I always try to start with a personal touch because we’re not just talking to robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should ask how someone’s doing before diving into work, especially if you haven’t spoken to them in a while. Just like in person, you don’t walk up to someone and immediately ask them for a status update. Start with a greeting, then get into the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Exactly. It helps build rapport and makes the conversation feel more human. It also shows that you care about the other person beyond just the task at hand. Any final thoughts as we wrap up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I had one, but it’s gone now. My brain isn’t braining anymore!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />The best part is you can tell me later—async communication!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yes, exactly! I’ll ping you later. But seriously, if anyone listening has questions or specific scenarios where they want help improving their async communication, feel free to send me a message. I love helping with that kind of stuff!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Absolutely! And if you, the listeners, have any tips or strategies you use for async communication that we haven’t covered, please let us know. We’d love to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yes, and if you have any other topics you want to discuss with us, we’d be more than happy to have you on the show. We can talk, and, you know, shoot the poo—uh, I mean, shoot the shit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />And that is a sign that we’re wrapping up this episode of Woo Biz Chat!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />This is why Emma doesn’t close the show. Goodbye, and thanks to all our listeners!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-13 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-12 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-9 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-5 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"525\" height=\"525\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Airwallex.jpg?resize=525%2C525&ssl=1\" alt=\"Airwallex\" class=\"wp-image-80258\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-6\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.airwallex.com/integrations/woocommerce?utm_source=701Nn000009vJ0mIAE\">Airwallex</a></strong>: With <strong>Airwallex</strong> merchants are no longer forced to convert their foreign incoming payments into their home market currencies and they can use the funds to pay suppliers internationally.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-11 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-7 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-10 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Omnisend-square.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78802\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-8\"><strong><a href=\"https://your.omnisend.com/onlywoo_dothewoo\">Omnisend</a></strong>: Whether it&#8217;s for integration into your Woo product, or building sites for clients, <strong>Omnisend</strong> is the solution for email and SMS marketing with their CRM solution for WooCommerce shops and your own website.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo BizChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Adam Weeks</strong> and <strong>Emma Young</strong> dive into the world of asynchronous communication, sharing insights on how to effectively communicate across different time zones and platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore the do’s and don’ts of async communication, the importance of over-communicating, using emojis and tone to convey clarity, and when to switch to a real-time conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam and Emma also tackle the tricky topic of swearing in professional contexts, the value of getting feedback, and how to build rapport while keeping communication clear and human. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over-communicating is better than under-communicating</strong>: In asynchronous communication, providing thorough context is essential, especially if the person hasn’t met you in person or doesn’t know your communication style. Clear, detailed messages help avoid misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use emojis strategically</strong>: Emojis can add warmth and tone to otherwise cold, text-based communication. However, don’t overdo it—use them to enhance clarity and express emotions without distracting from the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Break up complex messages</strong>: When you need to ask multiple questions or cover several topics, break your message into separate posts or threads to keep discussions organized and avoid overwhelming the recipient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Timing and consistency matter</strong>: Whether it’s a recurring meeting agenda or an important message, being consistent with when and how you communicate helps establish predictability and reliability in your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to switch to real-time communication</strong>: If a conversation becomes too complex or emotional, it’s often best to switch from async to synchronous communication. A quick Zoom call or Slack huddle can save time and prevent misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be mindful of your audience</strong>: Different cultures and communication styles may require adjusting your approach. Always be respectful and considerate, especially when using acronyms, jargon, or informal language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback is key</strong>: Regularly ask for feedback on your communication style to improve. It helps you ensure that your messages are clear and interpreted as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set expectations clearly</strong>: Don’t be afraid to set clear deadlines and expectations in your messages. It’s unkind to be unclear—people appreciate knowing when something is due or when to take action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use peer reviews for important messages</strong>: When sending out important or client-facing communication, consider drafting in a tool like Google Docs and getting feedback from peers before hitting send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know when it’s okay to swear</strong>: Swearing in async communication depends on the company culture and your relationship with the person you’re communicating with. Keep it professional, especially in client-facing conversations, and avoid being the first to swear.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 09:38:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"HeroPress: How WordPress and My Work Help Me Stay on Board During the War – Як WordPress та робота допомагають мені залишатись на плаву під час війни? \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=7335\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:198:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-and-my-work-help-me-stay-on-board-during-the-war/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-wordpress-and-my-work-help-me-stay-on-board-during-the-war\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34865:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/090624-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />\nHere is Lana reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#ukranian\">Це есе також доступно українською.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Lana Miro, shortened for Svitlana. I’m a Partnerships Manager at Crocoblock. This article is my personal story about how WordPress and my work have been helping me stay on board during the war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-brief-introduction\">Brief Introduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m 28 years old, born and raised in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. It’s a peaceful, small city (<em>before the war, about 400,000 people lived here</em>). I never thought about moving because travelling and exploring other cities for short periods was enough for me. Mykolaiv was always my comfort zone, where I felt safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This city provides me with a sense of peace – the river, the parks… the river – yes, I’m a fan of water. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30a.png\" alt=\"🌊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/Lana_Miro/status/1822876256439857433\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"807\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CleanShot-2024-09-04-at-17.34.57@2x-1024x807.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7336\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-introduction-to-wordpress\">My Introduction to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began my journey with WordPress in 2017 when I started an internship at TemplateMonster. That’s when I discovered this incredible platform that captivated me with its scope and possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TemplateMonster, I worked as a Partnerships Manager. At that time, the company’s niche was templates for various CMS platforms. So, I’m well-acquainted with all of WordPress’s competitors. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f604.png\" alt=\"😄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my three years with the company,<strong> I realized that WordPress was the largest and most interesting CMS for me.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The community and the number of people creating content about WordPress is enormous!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A variety of plugins and templates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An interesting and intuitive dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, I started experiencing issues with my back and mental health, so I decided to take a one-year break. I left the project and rejoined another Holding project a year later – Crocoblock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crocoblock was a breath of fresh air for me because of its amazing community and cool plugins that I wanted to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />My main tasks involved finding partners for collaboration, organizing events, and more. I’ve described partnerships in more detail in my free guide – <a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/free-ebook-wordpress-partnerships-basics-61635d13f82a?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------\"><em>WordPress Partnerships Basics</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-invasion-how-to-work\">Invasion: How to Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The war with Russia has been ongoing since 2014, so the Russian invasion in 2022 wasn’t a surprise to us. However, what was surprising – that bombs, missiles, and artillery could be used with such intensity in the 21st century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first two weeks, we were paralyzed. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f614.png\" alt=\"😔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-beginning\">The beginning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two weeks of the war were a real shock. We were all paralyzed, but the Crocoblock team quickly came together, creating an operational chat to support each other. This was a time when<strong> words, actions, and even just being present in the chat meant so much</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f499.png\" alt=\"💙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one of our employees immediately went to the army, so we collected money, and our developers bought everything he needed to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked my work email on the second day of the escalation. Lying in the basement, with the internet barely reaching, I decided, “<em>I’m relatively safe, so I can respond to partners</em>.” I reviewed critical messages, and let them know that we were okay and would respond as soon as we adapted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days later, we decided to<a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/blog/wordpress-community-supports-ukraine/\"> write a blog post</a> to let the Community know we were okay and to explain what was happening. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f625.png\" alt=\"😥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two weeks of lying in the basement (<em>yes, my family of nine spent two weeks in the basement, occasionally sleeping in the corridor or bathroom for safety</em>), a bomb was dropped near our street, and that became a critical moment for our family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By a majority vote, we decided to move to the western part of our country.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-adaptation-period\">Adaptation period</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we were safe, I was able to start working at 100% (<em>okay, maybe 80%, as 20% of me was still in shock </em><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f623.png\" alt=\"😣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />). Of course, the news, conditions, and stress affected me, but <strong>work helped me get back into a routine and begin to adapt.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work became my lifeline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It brought me back to life, giving me a <strong>sense of stability</strong> when everything around me was falling apart. We recorded a video message for our clients, which was an important step not only for synchronization but also for my personal recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention the numerous words of support we received afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We once again realized that <strong>Crocoblock clients are the best</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49a.png\" alt=\"💚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the team immediately moved to safer cities or went abroad. But some stayed in Mykolaiv, and Anna, our CEO, was in an occupied city – Kherson. But that’s her story. I was incredibly happy when she finally left the occupation, and <strong>we exhaled in relief</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three months (<em>which felt like a year</em>), my husband and I decided to move closer to Mykolaiv to be near his parents. It was safe there, but due to the constant changes, my depression reached its peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, part of Kherson was liberated, and Mykolaiv was being shelled less frequently, so we decided to <strong>return home</strong>. That’s when I started treatment with a psychiatrist. She helped stabilize my condition and bring me back.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/231b.png\" alt=\"⌛\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4af.png\" alt=\"💯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <strong>2022 was the hardest year for me and my family</strong>, but the ability to work and be part of the WordPress community helped me<strong> Just Continue</strong>.

This helped me during my depression. The war brought changes, and I became more anxious, chaotic and found it hard to focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f469-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"👩‍💻\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <strong>The constant support from my manager was also crucial.</strong> My manager is Anna, our CEO. I regularly receive feedback from her, which is often needed to work better. She also supports my initiatives and ideas, which is incredibly motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to implement her skills in managing my team of three wonderful women – Victoria, Community Manager; Nikki, Content Marketer; and Dashel, our blog Editor. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/crocoblock-team-1024.webp\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/crocoblock-team-1024.webp\" alt=\"Crocoblock Team\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7337\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-today\">Today</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m writing this article on August 26, during one of the biggest attacks by Russia (<em>just one day after our Independence Day celebration</em>).

Thanks to monitoring channels, we can continue to live and hide in shelters when they announce. I had breakfast, did some exercise, and started working with sirens in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next came the emergency electricity offs, as one of Russia&#8217;s goals is to break our energy system and plunge our country and people into chaos. But besides anger and hatred, I no longer feel anything for them.

Я – партнерський менеджер у Crocoblock. Ця стаття – моя особиста історія про те, як WordPress і робота допомагають мені залишатися на плаву під час війни в Україні.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-короткий-вступ\">Короткий вступ</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Мені 28 років, я народилась і проживаю у місті Миколаїв, Україна. Це спокійне, не велике місто (до війни, тут проживало близько 400 тис. людей). Я ніколи не задумувалась про переїзд, бо мені було достатньо подорожей і дослідження інших міст на короткий період. А от Миколаїв завжди залишався моєю комфортною зоною, де я почувала себе в безпеці.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тут є те, що дає мені відчуття спокою – річка, парки… річка – так, я фанат води.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30a.png\" alt=\"🌊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/Lana_Miro/status/1822876256439857433\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"807\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CleanShot-2024-09-04-at-17.34.57@2x-1024x807.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7336\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-знайомство-з-wordpress\">Знайомство з WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Я почала свій шлях з WordPress у 2017 році, коли прийшла на стажування до TemplateMonster. Тоді я відкрила для себе цю неймовірну платформу, яка захопила мене своєю масштабністю і можливостями.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>У TemplateMonster, я працювала менеджером з партнерств. На той період ніша компанії – це шаблони для різних CMS. Тому я обізнана з усіма конкурентами WordPress. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png\" alt=\"😀\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Протягом 3х років роботи в компанії, я зрозуміла, що WordPress найбільша і найцікавіша для мене CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чому?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ком’юніті та кількість людей, які створюють контент про WordPress – величезна!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Різноманітність плагінів, шаблонів</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Цікавий і інтуїтивний дашборд&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>У 2020, під час Covid, я почала більше відчувати проблеми зі спиною і ментальним здоров’ям, тому вирішила зробити паузу на 1 рік. Звільнилась з проекту і поновилась через рік у інший проект холдингу – Crocoblock.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crocoblock став для мене новим ковтком повітря, бо тут крутезне ком’юніті і класні плагіни, з якими хочеться працювати.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Моїми основними завданнями було пошук партнерів для співпраці, організація заходів, і т.д. Більше про партнерства, я описала у своєму, безкоштовному посібнику – <a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/free-ebook-wordpress-partnerships-basics-61635d13f82a?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------\">WordPress Partnerships Basics</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-повномасштабна-війна-як-працювати\">Повномасштабна Війна: як працювати?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Війна з росією триває з 2014 року, тому для нас не був сюрпризом наступ росіян 2022. Але сюрпризом було, що у 21 столітті можуть використовуватись бомби, ракети, та артилерія в такій інтенсивності.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Перші 2 тижні ми були паралізовані. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f614.png\" alt=\"😔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-початок\">Початок</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Перші два тижні війни були справжнім шоком. Ми всі були паралізовані, але команда Crocoblock швидко згуртувалася, створивши оперативний чат для підтримки один одного. Це був час, коли слова, дії і навіть просто присутність у чаті значили дуже багато.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f499.png\" alt=\"💙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>наприклад, наш співробітник одразу пішов воювати, тому ми зібрали гроші і наші розробники купили все що йому потрібно для початку</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На робочу пошту я зайшла десь на другий день ескалації. Лежачи в підвалі, інтернет трошки дотягував, тому я вирішила – “<em>Я відносно в безпеці, отже можу відповісти партнерам :D</em>”. Я оглянула критичні повідомлення, дала знати що у нас все окей і відповімо якомога скоріше як адаптуємось.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Через пару днів, ми вирішили <a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/blog/wordpress-community-supports-ukraine/\">написати блог статтю</a>, щоб дати знати нашим клієнтам та партнерам – ми в порядку і що взагалі відбувається. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f625.png\" alt=\"😥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Через 2 тижні, лежачи в підвалі (<em>так, 2 тижні моя сім’я з 9 людей провела в підвалі, періодично сплячи в коридорі або ванній кімнаті дому для безпеки</em>) недалеко від нашої вулиці скинули бомбу і це стало критичним моментом для нашої сім’і. І методом голосування – ми виїхали на захід нашої країни.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-період-адаптації\">Період адаптації</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Будучи в безпеці, я змогла почати працювати на всі 100 <em>(ну окей, на 80%, 20% мене ще досі було шокована</em><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f623.png\" alt=\"😣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />). Звичайно, новини, умови і стан стресу вплинули, але робота допомогла повернутись в режим і почати адаптуватись.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Робота стала моїм рятівним колом. Вона повернула мене до життя, дала мені відчуття стабільності, коли все навколо руйнувалося. Ми записали відеозвернення для наших клієнтів, що стало важливим кроком не лише для синхронізації, але й для мого особистого відновлення.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Не кажучи вже про численну кількість слів підтримки, яку ми отримали потім.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ми ще раз зрозуміли –<strong> Crocoblock клієнти – найкращі</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49a.png\" alt=\"💚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Частина команди одразу переїхала в безпечніші міста або виїхала закордон. Але дехто залишався в Миколаєві, а Анна – наша CEO взагалі була в окупованому місті – Херсон. Але це вже її історія. Я була неймовірно рада коли вона нарешті виїхала з окупації і ми видихнули з полегшенням.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Після 3х місяців (<em>для мене вони тягнулись як рік</em>), я і мій чоловік вирішили переїхати ближче до Миколаєва до його батьків. Там було безпечно, але через зміни, моя депресія досягла апогею.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На щастя, звільнили частину Херсону і Миколаїв став менше обстрілюватись, тому ми вирішили повернутися додому. Де я почала лікування з психіатром.

Завдяки моніторинговим каналам, ми можемо продовжувати жити і підглядати коли треба сховатись в укриття. Я поснідала, зробила зарядку і почала працювати з серенами на фоні (це значно краще ніж вибухи).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Далі почались аварійні відключення, бо одна з цілей росії – зламати нашу енергосистему і ввести нашу країну і людей в хаос.

This is an All Things WordPress and WooCommerce podcast, and this is the Emerging Tech series. I am your host, Dave Lockie, and for this episode, we&#8217;ve got Thomas Shellberg, who is representing the Applied AI team from Automattic, and therefore one of my colleagues. Hi, Thomas. Thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Hi, Dave. I&#8217;m doing great. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Perfect. So today we wanted to talk a little bit about what Automattic is up to with AI, and you are the best person I can think of to talk us through that. So, I guess maybe first let&#8217;s just start with you. What&#8217;s your background? How did you come to be at Automattic, and when did you join the Applied AI team, and why? What were you doing before, and what was so appealing about jumping into this team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yeah, thanks. So, I&#8217;ve actually been at Automattic for nine years now. Before then, I was working for WooThemes, which was before it became WooCommerce and before it was acquired by Automattic. I&#8217;ve been working with Woo for a long time. Yeah, one of the originals— I think we were about 35 people. It was a very scrappy, small company when I joined. I was hired as a Happiness Engineer in 2014, and I worked there for five years before I started to get really interested in programming. I became essentially the first junior developer at Automattic in 2020 and became a full-time engineer. I was working on Woo Pay and some other Woo payments and projects, extensions, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much after GPT-3 came out, I started to get really interested in the LLM (large language model) side of machine learning and AI. Before that, I had done some AI courses, the more traditional machine learning courses by Andrew Ng, from the famous Stanford course. But yeah, I started to run some experiments and began thinking about ways that WooCommerce could utilize this new LLM technology and some of the magic that apparently came out of this &#8220;black box.&#8221; I was quite vocal about my experiments and ideas, and we eventually created a Woo AI team—sort of an experimental, short-term team to explore what kind of projects in WooCommerce could utilize AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our biggest achievement was the Woo AI plugin that we shipped to about 10,000 customers, and it still gets used to this day. The plugin mainly helps with generating product descriptions, product titles, categories, and even includes a background removal tool for images. After that, I moved into the Applied AI team, which focuses more on WordPress.com functionality and how we can improve it. I’ve been on the Applied AI team since May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />What a lovely story! Coming from a Happiness background and ending up really in the thick of it, the cutting edge of what we&#8217;re trying to do as a business—it must feel like a great ride you&#8217;ve been on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yeah, and I think everyone should do some kind of tech support or customer support in their lifetime. It really helps you develop a level of empathy for your customers that you can’t replicate just by using the product short-term. I think it really, really helps in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s almost unlimited in the number of ways someone can misunderstand, misuse, or break a piece of technology. I&#8217;ve done a lot of customer support myself over the years, so, yeah, strong plus-one from me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />You can never fully predict how people will use your products, especially something as flexible as WooCommerce or WordPress. People find interesting ways to use a product that you never thought of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Totally. My background is in agency freelancing and then running an agency, and I always used to say there are a million ways to build a WordPress site, but only a handful of ways that are actually right or good for the long term. I think that remains true to this day, and it&#8217;s definitely something I’m passionate about in my day-to-day work—figuring out when to be more opinionated about how to build successful sites and stores using Automattic’s suite of products and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, there are different tribes or mini-ecosystems within the greater space. For example, if you’re building on Elementor, there’s a whole bunch of stuff that comes along with that. But Automattic has its own de facto set of opinions. We think that if you&#8217;re going to do e-commerce on WordPress, you should be using WooCommerce, Gutenberg, and Jetpack. Trying to find that balance between flexibility and customizability while also having opinions and guardrails to ensure product compatibility and a consistent user experience—both on the front and back ends—is a really interesting problem to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />I think that&#8217;s a really interesting point, and it&#8217;s very relevant at this moment. We’ll get into some of the projects we’re working on, but that’s exactly what we’re dealing with—finding the balance between freedom and opinionated patterns, presets, or decisions about how a website should look and what an AI should do for you, versus leaving things open for customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Awesome. That’s a nice and natural segue. Why don’t you tell us some of the things that you’re up to—maybe some of the things you’ve shipped and are iterating on, and maybe some of the active projects you’re working on now? Then we can leap into the future a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Sure. I’d say we have three major projects. One of them is public, and one is sort of behind the scenes but kind of public. The first one is the Jetpack AI Assistant. It’s a contextual AI assistant that lives inside the Gutenberg editor. It’s highly contextual, so if you select a text block, you’ll see AI options like &#8220;translate this text,&#8221; &#8220;rewrite this,&#8221; or &#8220;correct mistakes,&#8221; which is really cool. It’s built into the editor, so it doesn’t add any extra level of abstraction or anything unfamiliar. It’s just part of what you already know. So, that’s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an extra plan inside of Jetpack. It can also generate images, helping to make your pages and posts more interesting and appealing. Instead of hunting for a stock image that might not fit perfectly, you can use AI-generated images that match your needs. It’s really good for outlining posts too. Usually, the hardest part of writing is starting from nothing, and having an outline really helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, I totally agree. There’s always the challenge of a blank piece of paper. You have a rough idea, but how do you shape it quickly? When you&#8217;re writing casually, you can leave things half-finished and come back to them, but if you&#8217;re a professional marketer or under pressure to produce content regularly, you need to quickly form a good idea of what the end product will look like. I think AI helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it’s great for keeping you in a particular mode—whether you’re creating or editing. I often find that when I’m in a creative mode, the editorial side of my brain starts creeping in, and it gets distracting. With an AI assistant, I know I can focus on the creative part now and rely on the machine to handle the editing later. What kind of feedback have you received about how the Jetpack AI Assistant is being used?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Oh, that&#8217;s a good question. I’d have to get back to you with specifics, but I do know we have quite a few users who love it. Feedback has been good. I don&#8217;t have the numbers right now, but I can get them to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Cool. Sorry to put you on the spot there. No worries! Hard questions, even if we&#8217;re on the same team, Thomas. Good stuff. Alright, so project number one is the in-editor assistant. What’s project number two?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Project number two is called Odie. Odie is basically our in-house WordPress.com chat system. You can think of it as a chatbot platform. It has access to and is trained on all WordPress.com documentation, so it provides accurate answers to common questions from WordPress.com users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One bot, called WaaPu, is available via a chat interface natively within the WordPress.com admin area. When you search for help, that’s the first thing that pops up. It’s a conversational interface, and it’s actually doing quite well. We make it clear that it’s powered by AI because we want to be as transparent as possible. The main benefit is that WordPress.com users get help super fast, often resolving their issues right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 30–40% of support volume is handled by this chatbot, with high customer ratings. It’s really good for repetitive questions that come up from documentation and don’t require creative troubleshooting. People appreciate getting immediate answers rather than waiting for a response from a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That makes total sense. If you’re in a rush, you’ll settle for a quick coffee out of a machine rather than waiting for a handcrafted brew. I guess ticket completion rates are higher than expected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yes, higher than I expected! What’s cool is that our Happiness Engineers (HEs) help improve WaaPu’s quality. Tickets answered by Odie are reviewed by HEs, who give them ratings, so it gets better based on what our Happiness Engineers would reply with. There’s a human feedback loop improving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />And the name Odie—wasn’t that a cartoon dog from Garfield?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yes, technically it’s short for Odysseus, but yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>there’s Odie from Garfield too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Maybe there’s a double meaning there. Hopefully, it&#8217;s smarter than Garfield&#8217;s Odie! It sounds like it is. I didn’t realize we were seeing such an impact. Often people don’t know what question to ask—they know what they’re trying to achieve but not the terminology to use. Chatbots can crystallize what they’re really asking. Do you think that’s fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. There are multiple benefits. By automating simple and repetitive questions, Happiness Engineers have more time for complex, creative problem-solving, which is more stimulating and uses more of their knowledge. When I was a Happiness Engineer, I worked on the most complex tickets at WooCommerce, and it was much more engaging than handling password resets all day. So, there’s a second benefit for people craving a bit more complexity and creativity in their job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That’s about moving up the value chain and building stronger relationships with customers. Instead of answering repetitive queries, we can focus on novel challenges with our customers, which adds value. It ties into that earlier point about balancing customization with guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, tell us about project three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Project three is ongoing and codenamed Big Sky. It’s our most ambitious project—essentially an AI assistant for building your first website on WordPress.com. We’re targeting people who recognize WordPress.com as a great place to build a site but don’t know how to design one. Being launched into a blank page can be intimidating, so as part of onboarding, this assistant helps generate an initial site layout that looks good. Then, the user can tailor it without needing to know anything about web design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to make the process intuitive, even for users with no prior experience with WordPress. We&#8217;re really excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Interesting. So, this essentially teaches users by allowing them to change something already set up? They can see how blocks are composed, and by editing the blocks, they learn how the tool works. It’s easier to tweak something than to start from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. It’s very hard to start from scratch. Even if you have a rough idea, it’s easier to see something similar and make it your own. It speeds up the process massively. The challenge we’re working on is ensuring users don’t feel dropped into the deep end with Gutenberg. We want to guide them through the experience without overwhelming them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />I can see how this reduces the tension of tweaking vs. starting from scratch. It helps users stay creative and experiment, allowing them to take control in ways that feel natural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Exactly. We&#8217;re targeting business owners who want to focus on their business and the creative aspect of running it. We want to lower the barrier to entry by making website building intuitive, rather than making them learn web design to run their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Totally agree! This also feels essential for the future of websites. Many other digital channels, like social media, are intuitive and easy to use from the start. We need websites to have a similar experience—something that just works without needing expert advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. Our idea is to grow with the user. Initially, the site may not need complex functionality, but as their business grows—whether that means taking payments, adding members, or shipping inventory—we’ll be there with modular solutions that meet their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That makes sense. It aligns perfectly with our mission of democratizing publishing. Thanks for sharing everything that Automattic’s up to. I’ve learned a lot today, and I’m sure our listeners have too. Will you be at WordCamp US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Unfortunately, I won’t be there. I’m in Germany and have a broken foot, so flying isn’t an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Oh no! Best wishes for a swift recovery! Thanks again, Thomas, and take care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>All Things WordPress Woo, Emerging Tech</strong> series, host <strong>Dave Lockie</strong> chats with T<strong>homas Shellberg from Automattic&#8217;s Applied AI team</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore Automattic&#8217;s recent AI projects, including the Jetpack AI Assistant for content creation, the Odie chatbot for in-house WordPress.com support, and Big Sky, an ambitious AI-driven tool for helping users build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas shares insights on the role of AI in enhancing user experience, reducing complexity, and supporting small businesses. They also discuss the evolving landscape of e-commerce, AI&#8217;s potential to democratize web development, and the future of AI-powered solutions in WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Projects</strong>: Automattic is working on several AI-driven projects, including the Jetpack AI Assistant for content creation, Odie, an in-house chatbot for WordPress.com support, and Big Sky, an AI assistant that helps users build their first website. Each project aims to simplify tasks and improve user experience across WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI in Content Creation</strong>: The Jetpack AI Assistant integrates directly into the Gutenberg editor, offering users contextual suggestions for rewriting, translating, and improving content. It can also generate images and outlines to help users overcome the &#8220;blank page&#8221; problem when writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automation in Customer Support</strong>: The Odie chatbot, used on WordPress.com, handles about 30-40% of support volume, answering common and repetitive questions quickly. This allows Happiness Engineers to focus on more complex and creative customer problems, improving overall support quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simplifying Website Creation</strong>: Big Sky, Automattic&#8217;s most ambitious AI project, aims to help users—especially those with no web design experience—build their first website on WordPress.com. By generating an initial layout, users can easily modify their site without starting from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Empowering Small Businesses</strong>: Automattic’s AI tools, particularly in WooCommerce, aim to democratize e-commerce by giving small businesses access to tools that are typically available to larger companies. These tools can help artisans and entrepreneurs create professional websites without the need for technical expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Flexibility and Opinionation</strong>: A recurring theme is the challenge of balancing flexibility with providing opinionated guidance. Automattic&#8217;s goal is to maintain the customizable nature of WordPress and WooCommerce while offering users more structured, streamlined experiences with the help of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future of E-commerce Analytics</strong>: Automattic is also working on improving WooCommerce analytics with AI-driven insights that can provide actionable feedback for merchants. This includes personalized suggestions on how to improve store performance based on industry benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI’s Role in Democratizing Technology</strong>: The discussion highlights how AI can lower the barriers for small business owners, reducing the complexity and cost of building and managing websites, and allowing them to compete with larger brands.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:23:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team to Close Inactive Meetup Groups by September 16, 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-to-close-inactive-meetup-groups-by-september-16-2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2245:\"<p>Automattic’s Community Engagement Specialist, Devin Maeztri, has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/09/06/final-reminder-inactive-meetup-groups-will-be-closed-in-september-2024/\">announced</a> that the WordPress Community Team will close all inactive meetup groups by September 16, 2024.

Organizers have until <strong>September 16</strong> to confirm if they wish to remain active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the list, 22 meetups have already requested closure. Spain leads with six closure requests, followed by the USA (4), France (3), and Indonesia (3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meetup groups that fail to respond will be removed from the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I&#8217;m well, Gigi, and yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Doing well too, thank you. So, for this podcast, let me introduce myself. I am Gigi JK. I run an eCommerce engineering company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />And I am Steve Tamulewicz with eCreations out of Phoenix, Arizona. Also a WordPress and WooCommerce platform engineer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Alright, so a little bit more about my company. We are a WooCommerce certified agency. However, we have expertise in multiple eCommerce platforms, and we differentiate ourselves from most of the other agencies by being an eCommerce engineering company. The reason why is that, for us, eCommerce is like a car rally, and in order to win the race, you need a great driving team—that&#8217;s your marketing agency—and then you need a great hardcore engineering team to figure out what the right car engineering you need to have and what the right gears it should have. That&#8217;s where Virtina comes in. I started as a software engineering company, Virtina. Then we saw this need in the marketplace for a good software engineering company, just like a good car engineering company. There was a need for a great eCommerce engineering company. So we shifted the focus from being a software engineering company to an eCommerce engineering company. The last point is, 90%—no, 98%—of my clients are small to medium-sized businesses. But once in a while, we get a client like Amazon or the world&#8217;s largest democratic country. When they get into trouble, and somehow our name gets passed around, they come to us, and we do a good job at it. And we have other agencies also work with us behind the scenes, in front of the scenes, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, we, on the other hand, are focused on Woo. So, when we have clients who come to us with a certain challenge, we want to understand what our client&#8217;s end game is. And a lot of times, if they&#8217;re sold on a different platform than Woo, I haven’t done my job. But if they are, I will turn them over to XII, or if they need someone in their specific geographic region, we work with other verified experts as we are, and as you are, Gigi. But you&#8217;re absolutely right when you say that we have to understand the client, and I love the race car analogy. We’ve got to put together the pieces. I still need to make a living, but if it’s not right for the client, I’m not going to put myself in that position. So, most of our clientele is probably mid-to-enterprise level, and I think you and I are probably one of six or seven in the country who get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always get the calls to fix things, but a lot of times, when other agencies or freelancers say, &#8220;This can&#8217;t be done,&#8221; you call one of us guys. So, we like the data analysis. We like working with them to make sure that they come up with the right solution, whether it be Woo or not. If it is, great, we&#8217;ll work with them, and we&#8217;ll start doing the architecture and going through that. If it&#8217;s not, then we have no problem referring. As a background, Gigi and I, we met—was it in &#8217;16 or &#8217;17?—up in Seattle at WordCamp. It was a good party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Just before COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes. So, I think that kind of sums up what we do. I was thinking about this podcast, Gigi, and I wanted to ask you—you brought up a good segue—did COVID affect you? And if it did, did you become busier? Did you slow down? How did that happen? What was your experience with the whole COVID thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Very good question. By being in this space, competing with other digital marketing agencies, with our background, we have specific challenges every day, right? I&#8217;m talking specifically, as I mentioned, we are a software engineering company focused on eCommerce, right? We are not a marketing agency, and we compete with the marketing agents, the gurus, the pundits, and experts who are really good in marketing. We compete with them. When COVID happened, it just hit us really badly. We had to take certain steps internally. I&#8217;m very grateful to my team, some of whom have been with me for more than a decade—even predating me in the company—and the team stuck with us, giving me a lot of support to go through those challenges. We learned a lot of things that made us resilient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, when a lot of agencies went out of business, and other businesses as well, we are still here. And if I sum up what made us strong, it was how to market better. Our marketing became our storytelling, and our marketing became way better because COVID forced us to do that. That’s one thing. The second thing we learned is that our lead source used to be leads from partner platforms and organic. The shift was, 90% of the leads came from platforms and 10% from organic. Today, because of COVID, we were able to change the equation to just the opposite—90%, 98% from organic, and almost 1% from any other sources. It taught us a lot of lessons. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, it was interesting. It was challenging. We were considered essential with what we do, and I give my team credit. Again, I&#8217;ll give my team more credit than you gave yours, how’s that? Without my team—they all had options to work from home, and we had the protocols in place, obviously—but it was odd because there was a paradigm shift. I think we have a lot of brick-and-mortar and online clients, and we deal with a lot of clients that have both. Because brick-and-mortar sales went down, their eCommerce sales just went through the roof, and that opened everyone&#8217;s eyes. They realized, &#8220;Hey, we were able to do this in the store, we need to be able to do that online too.&#8221; And short of coding &#8220;smell-o-vision,&#8221; it was very difficult and challenging for us to be quickly reactive based on the decline of in-store traffic and the increase in online traffic. So, we got through it. It was fun, it was challenging, and it was definitely a learning experience. I think with the whole COVID era of 2020 and 2021, everyone learned, especially with online commerce. Regardless of the platform, I think everyone learned that it’s here to stay. Obviously, you have all these stores still today going out of business, and I believe that’s because online commerce really accelerated during the COVID period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, true. There has been a big shift in the last, let’s say, 12 months with the advent of AI. I am curious to know—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />That I fired all my developers? I use ChatGPT for all my code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah. How is that affecting your marketing, your lead flow, the Google changes—GA or Mute—sometimes it&#8217;s there, sometimes it&#8217;s not there, right? And SEO versus GEO, all that AI stuff—how is it affecting your agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, we use AI as a pretty decent springboard. When we are in charge of content, product descriptions, or whatever the case may be, and we get writer&#8217;s block or creative block—it happens in every agency, right?—we’ll go to ChatGPT or another AI tool and say, &#8220;Okay, write me a description that says this.&#8221; And then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, alright, now I can get started.&#8221; It’s kind of like a kickstart, but then you have to make sure that it’s not recognized as AI. But we use it as a clutch in an engine. Going back to your race car analogy, we use it just to warm up the engine a little bit. Do you use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Of course, right. We’ve been using it for idea generation and idea evaluation, in terms of any form of content—idea generation and evaluation. When it comes to creating the meat of it—let’s say we’re talking a blog—we can create the table of contents, figure out and evaluate the ideas, topics, etc., and decide what’s good and what’s bad. Then we start generating the content. Well, initially—I&#8217;m smiling because about a year ago when I started pushing AI to our content writers, it took me about four or five months to change their minds because they were used to writing a certain way. Now here comes the tool. They said, &#8220;No, no, no, no!&#8221; But over time, their attitude changed. Now, today, we use the AI to write the content and then use human expertise to make sure it’s providing unique value and a unique perspective whenever we produce something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />And the right voice. It’s got to be the right tone and the right voice for the company you’re writing for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Exactly. But on the other hand, back in the day—when I say back in the day, let’s say six years ago—Google became stronger, and we had the problem of information overload. Everybody had that problem of information overload. There was a lot of information everywhere, and how do you condense that information? Then comes AI. Now we are able to take a huge amount of information, condense it, and ask, “What’s the expertise or the focus you&#8217;re looking for?” You</p>\n\n\n\n<p>can get the answers you want very fast. Sometimes, down to a three-word answer from a 5,000-word article. That’s amazing. Then we started thinking, &#8220;If we take that analogy, how can we help our customers? Is there a tool that will help us do the same thing for them?&#8221; Our customers are mostly small- to medium-sized businesses—business owners and marketing decision-makers. When it comes to their eCommerce businesses, they’re trying to figure out their strategy, their competitors, understanding their customers&#8217; needs and wants, and how to extrapolate a marketing strategy. Then, they have to figure out feature gaps, conversion gaps, and so on. So, I’ve been in search of a tool, and I recently found one called Inverse Hub. It’s not publicly available yet, but we’ve been lucky to be the initial guinea pigs. We’ve been testing it, and so far, it’s doing a great job for our very solid customers. We are using AI to help our clients understand their competitive landscape, their buyers&#8217; needs and wants based on data, and to understand their strengths and weaknesses. It’s creating strategies, action plans, content calendars, and all of the above. AI accelerates all of that. So, that&#8217;s the angle I&#8217;m very excited about in the last three months. Having that kind of partnership will help us succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I think it’s interesting with AI because, as a broader picture, it’s still in its infancy. The longer this goes, the more it’s a double-sided coin. It’s there to help, but I’m a little nervous to see what else it’s going to be able to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I can tell you what it&#8217;s going to do, based on my understanding. It’s going to help us make better, faster, more accurate decisions. That’s the benefit of it. But, it&#8217;s also going to make us dumb. Even though we’re making better, faster, and more accurate decisions, the tool is going to make us dumb. So, those who can stay sharp with the tool, understanding both the positives and negatives, are going to be the ones who win the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Interesting take on that, sir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, it’s going to make us not think for ourselves?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Not exactly. But, if we can think <em>with</em> the tool…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes, there we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Like with Inverse Hub. I really love that tool—that&#8217;s why I’m saying its name again. Similar tools will emerge in every industry. People who can think using the tool like that are going to be the true winners. But if somebody is going to truly depend upon and rely 100% on the tool itself…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I got you. I think we both use AI in kind of the same way. It’s interesting that your content writers didn’t want to touch it for a while, because I have three writers, and they looked at me and said, &#8220;Okay, let’s give this a shot.&#8221; I told them, &#8220;You better, because your deadline’s at 5 o’clock today.&#8221; So all of a sudden, it went from hesitation to adoption. I think for us, it may have been a quicker acceptance. But, as tools progress, it gets easier and easier. What was your first IDE that you used, right? Yeah, right after Notepad or Notepad++, and now they have things that will just automatically finish the flow. It’s an interesting time, and everything’s still young.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah. Someone told me last week that something came out in the market called Cursor, I think—code generator using natural language. There&#8217;s a lot of buzz around it now. I don’t know if it’s the talk of the town, but there’s a lot of buzz. I need to take a deep dive into it. I always wonder, and this is one of the positions I have—I always wonder how this will affect platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce. Let’s say three years from now, would I be able to generate a completely rich-featured eCommerce platform, better than my competition, addressing and understanding the needs of my customers, with all the features built in? What if it knows everything, and all it takes is a few lines of commands to generate it, right? So would that happen? If that happens, what will happen to the platforms?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I&#8217;ll tell you what would happen, in my opinion. You’d have the dog chasing its tail, hypothetically. If I can upload a photo of a product into some platform, and all of a sudden everything just starts spitting out, my competitor is going to do the same thing. So now it&#8217;s going to come in, and it might really increase the competitiveness of commerce. I think it has the potential to do that. I’m sure it has that potential now. I still want the human touch, because it&#8217;s important. Regardless of whether you say, &#8220;Hey, write this in the tone of so-and-so,&#8221; you still need some human interaction. I think there will always be a need for people with fingers and toes and eyes and ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, I totally agree. This goes back to what we discussed a couple of minutes ago: the people who are going to depend upon the tool itself are going to die; they are going to become extinct. But the people who understand the tool, and then bring their human intelligence, are going to be the winners. I totally agree with that. But at the same time, as these tools become more mature, our need to be involved gets lesser and lesser. At some point, how will these platforms affect the game? How will the competitive landscape of the platforms themselves be affected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, AI keeps you up at night, thinking about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, it does. It does. Nowadays, I’ll tell you, getting older, and when we go to doctors, they’ll start prescribing us medicines. I come back, I put it into ChatGPT, just to make sure, &#8220;How does this react with my history?&#8221; Without my name or any identifiers, I can create avatars and say, &#8220;Hey, this guy, these are the problems, these are the medications. The next doctor—what should I watch for?&#8221; Even with that, it is giving me really good advice. The doctor prevails, of course. I’d say I’m a bit on the riskier side of that, but it’s okay for me because I have this tool, and I have the doctor as well. So I’m not completely AI-based, but before, I didn’t even have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />We all got our medical degrees from Google, and now we can get them from AI. That’s funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I’m curious to know how your company, eCreations, uses AI beyond content generation. What other ways do you use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />With AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, content calendar—everything dealing with content, obviously. Or if we get stuck and we’ve got a rogue semicolon somewhere, or this isn&#8217;t working, or this custom extension isn’t working that we&#8217;re making for Woo, ChatGPT will, again, shed light on maybe something we missed. It may give us a snippet of code that makes us say, &#8220;Interesting. Okay, cool.&#8221; So I think it provides us, again, with content, ideas, and answers to quick questions. But it also assists us with maybe a different set of eyes. Like, &#8220;Here’s my code, and I need it to do this,&#8221; or whatever the case may be. Again, just as content writers have content block, sometimes if you’re coding a custom plugin for Woo, or an extension, or whatever, you’re going through your thought process, and you’ve got your systems architecture in place. Everything’s great, planned and dandy, but you forgot a component. We’ve used that for funnels—not only for creation, but verification, and also just double-checking. Like, &#8220;Hey, what else am I forgetting?&#8221; kind of thing. So we use it as another tool to look at something with a different perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I see. Yeah. I’ll tell you. So, you primarily use it for content and code quality. We started with content, then went into code quality. Nowadays, my QA team is coming up with AI-based tools to increase the effectiveness of the QA itself. They use certain tools like TestRigor, and there’s another one, so they use these tools even beyond automated test tools like Selenium and others. Their life is getting better and easier, and therefore, more effective, using an AI-based QA process. Our UX team uses AI to understand the effectiveness of designs. They identify conversion leaks before they convert the designs into actual pages. We take that, and we’re just beginning to use that tool for ourselves to figure out our competitive landscape and marketing strategies—how to expand. So we started using that internally. Also, someone was telling me yesterday—you know the saying that every 18 months technology doubles in size or increases? Yesterday someone told me that’s now happening every 10 hours. Technology is making changes by many folds every 10 hours. I can see that in my business. The more and more we identify use cases to improve, not only our customer’s lives and their businesses but our own business as well, using AI. I’m very glad to see that it’s coming. And I’m not the only one driving this, pushing this. I used to be the one. Now our team leads are coming to me and the management team saying, &#8220;Why</p>\n\n\n\n<p>can&#8217;t we do this? Can we look into this?&#8221; So it’s exciting. It’s exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />You know what? That’s another good thing here, and I want your input on this. You and I have known each other for many years, and it was good to see Bob again. I saw him in San Diego in—was it 2020?—yeah, it was COVID time. So, I’d like to think that we’re the best in Phoenix, but there are other agencies around. There are agencies like you, Joe, Johnny, and everybody else, and we all get along. We see each other on the WooExperts channel through Automattic. And when we get together, there’s always this tension that I never quite understood. Not between us, but with other agency owners, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we’re all in the same ocean, we’re all in the same sea,&#8221; but there’s always this competition. I didn’t mean to bring that up earlier, where I’m going to crush you because I like you quite a bit. So, I understand the competitive part of it, and I understand that everyone has their specialty. If someone wants Shopify, I don’t do it, you do. So boom, we’re done. And at the end of the day, the client is at least directed to someone who can help, right? I’m curious to see if you’ve also ever experienced or are experiencing this fight to the death with other agencies, like, &#8220;My job is to get the deal, get the deal, get the deal!&#8221; Are you in that boat, or is it just a Phoenix thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I would say I have not experienced it. The reason I haven’t experienced it is that I have a couple of guys who watch the Slack space, what’s going on, and then whenever I need something, they tell me, &#8220;You get on it.&#8221; So I am always where they need me most, and I’m there. So, I don’t go into that kind of level to experience that. That’s why you don’t see me much at all in the gatherings, community gatherings, etc. I’m a little busy. If you need me, any agency needs me, I’m there deep. And you have been, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />So, it is unfortunate, but I believe it is there. I’m lucky not to experience that, but it is unfortunate that you identified that the ocean is big enough, and it is growing. There are agencies—well, we don’t discriminate against project sizes. We are fascinated. One of the biggest companies in the world came to us—this is in the office equipment business—they came to us, and the first project was $1,500. There was a high-risk merchant who came to us, and the first project was like $3,000. Then, he became a $75,000-per-year customer. He stayed with us, and in three years, that client became a $6 million client. So, this is eCommerce. We don’t discriminate against project size or revenue size. We love the complexity of it. But then there are agencies coming to us saying, &#8220;This is a $20,000 project, help us. We don’t want it,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is a $10,000 project, we don’t want it. Do you want it?&#8221; We take it. So, we operate in more of a collaborative space rather than a competitive one. What I’m trying to say is that kind of mechanism or mechanics is in the marketplace. But the ocean is big enough for us all to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yeah, it’s always interesting finding different agency owners&#8217; perspectives on it. It might be a city thing, because I have a lot of friends like you in different cities, and they’re in a very competitive, bigger city. And it’s like, guys, quantity, quality, or cost—choose two, because you can’t have all three. It’s all about the dollars with these larger organizations that say, &#8220;Hey, I have X number of dollars to spend. I’ve got to spend it by the end of the year. Here’s the scope of work. Can you do it for X?&#8221; And if the answer is no, they just move on. Then I’ll talk to you in six to eight months because you&#8217;re not going to get it delivered. It’s going to be bug-ridden, etc., etc., etc. So, I was curious to get your input on that. And yes, you are a busy person, I’ll give you that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, I’m lucky to have a couple of companies, a couple of agencies, that have partnerships with us. Maybe you’re too much out in the open. Maybe everybody’s seeing you as a threat, Steve, because you are a better marketer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Look at me, I’m not a threat!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />They see me as a network geek. &#8220;Oh, he’s a software engineering guy. He’s not a threat. He doesn’t know anything about marketing, that’s fine. He’s not a threat.&#8221; If they see you as a marketing agency guy, you’ve got more marketing muscle under your belt than me. I think that may be the reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Well, I always love talking to you, Gigi. I really do. And I’m glad that we kept in touch since we first met. But enjoy Florida. Take care of yourself, your family, and your team. And with that, I think this was a good conversation. I appreciate you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, likewise. It has been a wonderful journey so far. I’m glad that we crossed paths about six or seven years ago. It has been a blessing, Steve, and I wish you the best, both personally and professionally. If there’s anything I can do to help, please let me know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />The door’s open here too. So, if you ever get sick of the humidity down in Florida, come out to the heat in Phoenix. Today it’s 103 degrees!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Every day it rains, and it’s crazy humid! We’re going to be about 103 today, too. Yeah, it’s crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Alright, my friend. Thank you again. We’ll talk soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Alright, thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of<strong><em> Woo AgencyChat</em></strong>, <strong>Gigi J. Kizhakkechethipuzha</strong>, founder of <strong>Virtina</strong>, an eCommerce engineering company, joins <strong>Steve Tamulewicz</strong> from <strong>eCreations</strong>, a WooCommerce and WordPress platform engineering expert. Together, they dive into the all things with running a WooCommerce agency, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how their companies adapted to the shifting landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi and Steve share how they approach ecommerce challenges, from competing with marketing agencies to solving complex client problems. The conversation also dives into the increasing role of AI in the industry, discussing both its advantages and potential drawbacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Shift to eCommerce During COVID-19</strong>: Both Gigi and Steve shared how their businesses adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brick-and-mortar stores faced significant challenges, but eCommerce sales surged, highlighting the importance of having a strong online presence. The pandemic forced many companies to improve their digital strategies and embrace eCommerce as a permanent part of their business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of AI in eCommerce</strong>: AI has become a valuable tool for idea generation, content creation, and problem-solving in both companies. Gigi and Steve discussed how they use AI tools like ChatGPT to overcome creative blocks and code challenges, but both emphasized the need for human oversight to ensure the final product aligns with the brand&#8217;s tone and goals. AI is still in its infancy, and while it accelerates processes, companies need to stay sharp and not rely on it exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration Over Competition</strong>: Gigi emphasizes the importance of collaboration among agencies rather than seeing each other as competitors. He believes the &#8220;ocean is big enough&#8221; for everyone to thrive, and partnerships can lead to better outcomes for clients and businesses alike. Steve shares that some agency environments are highly competitive, but he shares Gigi’s perspective that collaboration is key to long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adaptability is Key to Growth</strong>: Both guest co-hosts highlight how adaptability has been critical to their success.

This helps in verifying and maintaining users&#8217; online presence and plays a significant role in keeping sensitive information safe from unauthorized access, which is mandated by privacy laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll discuss the complexities of securing online identities and guide you through the essentials of digital identity management. We’ll also show you how easy it is to start with <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> – a user-friendly platform that simplifies managing online identities for individuals and organizations, ensuring security and ease of use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding digital identity management and access management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One common mistake companies make is to confuse digital identity management with access management. In reality, the two concepts are related but not quite the same, and it’s important to know the differences between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital identity management involves the creation, management, and retirement of online identities. It&#8217;s the electronic footprint that represents an individual within a system, critical for identifying and authenticating users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might include assigning each employee a unique identifier (like an email address) upon joining. This identifier is used to create profiles in the company&#8217;s systems, granting access to relevant applications and data based on their role. As employees move within the company, their access rights are updated or revoked accordingly, ensuring security and compliance. The process also includes authentication methods, such as passwords or biometrics, to verify identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access management focuses on regulating what resources a user can access within a system. It&#8217;s about setting and enforcing rules and policies linked to an individual&#8217;s online identity and determining their permissions within an organization&#8217;s digital space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two other important terms you’ll often come across in this space are Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM). IAM covers the broad spectrum of managing user identities and their access rights, ensuring everyone has the appropriate entry to resources. PAM, however, narrows this focus to the high-stakes world of privileged accounts, those with the keys to the kingdom – meaning they have permissions to manage and secure access to critical systems and data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective digital identity management system is the foundation for solid access management. For instance, integrating a solution like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can simplify the intricacies involved in both areas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is a tool that allows users to create digital identities linked to their email addresses, and you can connect your website to Gravatar’s API to import relevant user data when that user signs up to your website. This allows you to utilize Gravatar as your digital identity verification system, allowing you to set relevant access rights for your users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding attributes of digital identities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifiers, attributes, and credentials are the foundation of digital identities, each playing an important role in online identity management. Let’s look at them in more detail:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identifiers</strong>, such as usernames or email addresses, act as the entry point, linking each digital identity to a unique online presence. Gravatar, for example, uses email addresses as a universal identifier to create a globally recognized profile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attributes</strong>, the personal details associated with an identifier, range from names to contact information, painting a fuller picture of the identity. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Credentials</strong> include passwords, biometric data, or security tokens. They serve as the key to authenticating and validating an individual&#8217;s claim to identity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping these details accurate and safe is crucial. If things go wrong, someone could steal an identity, get into places they shouldn’t, or even cause data leaks. That&#8217;s why companies use advanced systems to protect this information and follow strict rules to guard privacy and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Typical process of digital identity management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Provisioning and granting access</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You start by setting up the different digital identities and user accounts across platforms. This can vary from one organization to another, but the process is more or less like this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User registration: </strong>Enter basic details like name, email, and password.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verification:</strong> Confirm the email or phone via a sent link or code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Set up an additional verification step for login (more on that in the next step). </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Acceptance of terms: </strong>Agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Profile completion: </strong>Fill in additional personal or professional info.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Permissions for new users are set following guidelines from standards such as <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/27001\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISO/IEC 27001</a>, ensuring secure access control from the start. This approach ensures that access levels are appropriately assigned according to the user&#8217;s role within the organization, laying a foundational layer of security. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Authentication</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication is mandatory, and it can be done in many different ways. From traditional passwords to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and biometrics, each method strengthens security in its unique way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, managing multiple authentication methods across different platforms presents several challenges. It can lead to confusion among users who must remember various passwords and authentication steps, increasing the risk of password fatigue and security breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For administrators, it complicates security protocols, requiring extensive resources to monitor and update these systems to ensure they remain secure and user-friendly. Additionally, integrating and maintaining compatibility across diverse platforms can be technically challenging and time-consuming, straining IT departments and potentially leading to gaps in security coverage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Authorization</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorization is what dictates the actions that authenticated users are permitted to perform. This process, distinct from authentication, involves assigning specific roles and permissions, a task that grows increasingly complex across different systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different ways of doing this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): </strong>Assign access levels based on user roles (e.g., admin, editor).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): </strong>Grant permissions based on attributes (e.g., department).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Manual configuration: </strong>Admins manually set specific access rights as needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Default permissions: </strong>New accounts get basic access which can be adjusted later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Self-service permissions: </strong>Users can request more access, pending admin approval.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Lifecycle management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of digital identities requires continuous management throughout their lifecycle, from activation to eventual deactivation. The challenge here lies in ensuring these identities are accurately maintained and updated across numerous platforms. For example, companies need to make sure that ex-employees have zero access to important data such as accounts, documents, and passwords because they can take advantage of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this properly, businesses need to implement a systematic approach to manage these changes effectively and securely, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Federation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A federation is a set of agreements and standards that enable using a single identity across multiple systems. With technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Identity Providers (IdPs), users enjoy the convenience of accessing multiple services with one set of credentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is a great example of this federated approach, allowing a single, consistent identity to be recognized and utilized across various services, thereby simplifying the user experience and enhancing security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Auditing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Auditing is integral to ensuring that digital identity management processes remain compliant and secure. This involves comprehensive logging and monitoring, which can be a complex task for organizations with extensive digital footprints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective auditing practices are crucial for detecting security breaches and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards, forming a backbone for secure digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar facilitates digital identity management for website owners&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-homepage-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1636\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is a digital identity management solution for a wide range of online platforms, including websites, web applications, forums, eCommerce stores, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers users the ability to create a digital identity linked to their email address, enabling this identity to be consistently recognized across any platform that integrates Gravatar&#8217;s services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profile-example.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile example \n\" class=\"wp-image-1634\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially what this means is that when someone signs up to your website, the information you get from them comes directly from their Gravatar profile. This simplifies digital identity management for you as a website owner as Gravatar handles the storage and management of all user data, alleviating administrative burden and compliance hurdles for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits to using Gravatar:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Users carry their digital identity all over the web</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar stands out by providing what&#8217;s known as a “universal avatar”, a singular digital identity that moves with the user from one site to another. This universal recognition creates a streamlined online experience and means that you, as a website owner, can count on the accuracy and consistency of that user data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Users don’t fill in data multiple times</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most tangible benefits of Gravatar is the fact that users no longer need to fill in their details on every new site they visit; instead, their Gravatar profile carries their information across the web. This feature not only makes online navigation more efficient for users but also contributes to higher engagement rates on websites, as the barrier to participation is markedly lowered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data storage and management are handled by Gravatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s role in handling data storage and management can be very beneficial for website owners and businesses. The platform securely stores user information and avatars, taking on the responsibility of managing this data, which can be a complex and security-sensitive task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This offloads a considerable workload from organizations that might not have the resources or expertise to manage user data securely. Additionally, Gravatar’s adherence to data protection standards, including the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)</a> and the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"nofollow\">California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)</a>, ensures website owners comply with important privacy regulations, further reducing legal and operational risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You can create personalized experiences with user data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its centralized approach to data management, Gravatar prioritizes user privacy, ensuring that site owners can only access the information that users have agreed to share. This arrangement supports the creation of personalized experiences on websites without compromising user privacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website owners can tailor content, recommendations, and services to individual users based on the data available through Gravatar, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improve your digital identity strategy with Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growing amount of information stored online and the rise of cyber attacks, it’s becoming increasingly important for businesses to take digital identity management seriously, especially if they want to protect user data and streamline user experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting a third-party authentication service like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can greatly simplify this process and help you efficiently handle the intricacies of digital identity management.&nbsp;Gravatar offers a secure, user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between privacy concerns and the desire for a fluid online experience.

It&#8217;s like greeting new users and asking about their preferences, which makes them feel more valued, helps personalize the experience, and gives you insights to improve your product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you can make your microsurvey more effective:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep it simple, don&#8217;t overwhelm users.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask relevant questions so you can focus on improving user experience.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tell users how their answers help.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For multiple questions, indicate how many are left.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo</a> asks users which language they want to learn and why, personalizing the learning experience from the start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1323\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duoling-startup-screen.png\" alt=\"Duolingo startup screen\" class=\"wp-image-2137\" />\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1269\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-micro-survey-1.png\" alt=\"Duolingo micro survey\" class=\"wp-image-2138\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pre-gathering user data with Gravatar</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar can enhance your welcome process by auto-filling information with existing Gravatar profile data. Then, it can use the same data to personalize the welcome screen by showing the user&#8217;s profile picture and asking smarter questions instead of generic queries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating Gravatar can make your onboarding faster and more personal. Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">Gravatar&#8217;s API</a> to fetch user data based on the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/general/hash/\">user email hashes</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/avatars/\">Avatar API</a> to display the user&#8217;s Gravatar image on the welcome screen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-fill any available information in your micro survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tailor your questions based on the data you already have.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining a thoughtful welcome screen, a brief microsurvey, and Gravatar integration creates a smooth, personalized start to the user&#8217;s journey with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Segment your users based on goals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividing your users into groups based on what they want to achieve can make your onboarding process more effective. This approach helps you give each user the most relevant information and guidance, which is very likely to increase engagement and improve future adoption rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to segment users:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Use surveys or welcome messages</strong> to ask about their main objectives, such as &#8220;<em>What do you want to achieve with our product?</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group users with similar goals together.</strong> For instance, in a project management tool, you might have groups for personal use, small business, and enterprise users.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Design different onboarding flows for each user group</strong> and show features and tips most relevant to each group&#8217;s goals.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Choose onboarding and UI elements that work best for each group&#8217;s needs.</strong> For example, use tooltips for tech-savvy users and guided tours for beginners.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Real-world example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.videoask.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VideoAsk</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2069\" height=\"1040\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/videoask-onboarding.png\" alt=\"Videoask startup screen\" class=\"wp-image-2141\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.videoask.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VideoAsk</a>, a video survey platform, segments new users by asking them if they want to recruit talent or conduct research to understand their audience better. Then, based on the answer, it shows different features and tutorials. This approach ensures each user sees the most relevant parts of the product first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to regularly review and update your segments as you learn more about your users and how they use your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Utilize essential UX patterns&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your onboarding experience, you must use the right UX patterns to guide users effectively. These patterns help users quickly understand your product and its value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <strong>interactive walkthroughs and product tours</strong> are excellent ways to introduce new users to your product&#8217;s key features. They provide a virtual guide, reducing friction and improving understanding. When creating these, keep them concise and focused on core features. Use progress indicators to set expectations, and always allow users to exit or skip if they prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent example of this is the onboarding process of <a href=\"https://asana.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asana</a>, which allows new users to customize their projects from the get-go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/asana-onboarding-example.gif?w=660\" alt=\"Asana onboarding process\" class=\"wp-image-2142\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tooltips and hotspots are another way of providing contextual guidance as users explore your interface. They draw attention to specific elements and explain functionality without disrupting the user&#8217;s workflow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/asana-tooltips.png?w=660\" alt=\"Tooltips with Asana\" class=\"wp-image-2143\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When using tooltips, <strong>keep the copy clear and actionable</strong>. Use them sparingly to avoid overwhelming users, and make sure they&#8217;re easy to dismiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we have onboarding checklists and progress bars. These are effective tools for breaking down key setup tasks into manageable steps. They motivate users by gamifying the experience and providing a sense of accomplishment. When creating checklists, prioritize 3-5 key actions that deliver immediate value. <strong>Use clear, action-oriented microcopy, and celebrate when users complete all steps.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to add a resource center where users can self-serve their education and resolve issues independently, significantly reducing support costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravatar-support-center.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar support center\" class=\"wp-image-2144\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When setting up a resource center, organize content by topic and format. Make search functionality prominent and gather feedback to identify content gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal of these UX patterns is to help users understand and derive value from your product as quickly as possible. Each pattern serves a specific purpose, so choose the ones that best fit your product and user needs. Regularly test and refine these elements based on user feedback and behavior to continually improve your onboarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensure onboarding highlights value</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your onboarding process, focus on demonstrating how your product solves users&#8217; problems and improves their lives. This approach helps users quickly realize the benefits of your product, increasing the likelihood they&#8217;ll continue using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key strategy is to guide users to their &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment as quickly as possible. This is the point where they truly grasp the value of your product. To achieve this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep your onboarding process concise and focused on core benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use demo data or templates to help users visualize the product&#8217;s potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight key features that deliver immediate value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canva</a>, a graphic design platform, immediately shows users a gallery of templates they can use. This instantly demonstrates the product&#8217;s value by showing how easily users can create professional designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/canva-homepage-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Canva homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2145\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to facilitate setup and help users achieve quick payoffs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it: <strong>nobody likes a complicated setup process</strong>. The quicker users can get started and see results, the more likely they are to stick around. So, how do we make this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, let&#8217;s talk about making setup a breeze:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Use AI and machine learning to help guide users through setup based on their needs.</strong> For instance, <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/blog/announcing-resolution-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intercom&#8217;s Resolution Bot</a> learns from past conversations to answer user questions during setup. Or consider <a href=\"https://www.appcues.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Appcues</a>, which uses AI to suggest the best onboarding flow based on user behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/democues-app-demo.png?w=660\" alt=\"Democues app demo\" class=\"wp-image-2146\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Show, don&#8217;t just tell, with interactive walkthroughs that guide users step-by-step</strong>. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.walkme.com/\">WalkMe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pendo.io/\">Pendo</a> can create custom guides that adapt to each user&#8217;s progress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pendo-onboarding-tool.png?w=660\" alt=\"Pendo onboarding tool dashboard with tooltips\" class=\"wp-image-2148\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Do some of the work for users by pre-filing information where possible</strong>. Less typing for users means less frustration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Want to make the setup more fun? </strong>Try adding some game-like elements. Progress bars or achievement badges can turn a boring setup into a mini-adventure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, but how can you create those quick payoffs? The answer is simple: don&#8217;t make users guess why your product is great – show them! During onboarding, focus on showcasing immediate benefits. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have a project management tool, show how it can organize tasks in just a few clicks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For a fitness app, demonstrate how quickly users can set up a workout plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to connect your product&#8217;s features directly to the user&#8217;s needs or problems. Say something like, &#8220;<em>See how easy it is to track your team&#8217;s progress?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Look at that – you&#8217;ve just planned your whole week&#8217;s meals in under 5 minutes!</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give users some easy victories right off the bat. These quick wins should be simple tasks that pack a punch in showing your product&#8217;s value. For instance, in a photo editing app, you can let users apply a one-click filter that dramatically improves their photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, use what you know about your users to point them toward features they&#8217;ll love. This could be based on info they provided during sign-up or actions they&#8217;ve taken in the app. For example, if a user said they&#8217;re interested in running, a fitness app could highlight its running tracking features first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These personalized touches make users feel understood and help them get more out of your product faster. For more information, check out our guide on user experience personalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Drive users toward key actions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guiding users to perform key actions is crucial for ensuring they get the most value from your product quickly. These actions are the core activities that demonstrate your product&#8217;s usefulness and encourage continued engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To effectively drive users toward key actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Identify your product&#8217;s most important features or tasks.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design clear, action-oriented onboarding flows.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use prominent Calls-To-Action (CTAs) to guide users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider using gamification elements like progress bars or achievements to motivate users. For example, LinkedIn encourages profile completion by showing a progress meter and suggesting the next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization can make your guidance more effective. Use data from the sign-up process or initial interactions to tailor the key actions you suggest to each user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While guiding users is important, you also have to provide options for more exploratory or experienced users. Include easily accessible &#8220;<em>skip</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>learn more</em>&#8221; options in your onboarding flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to measure the completion rate of these key actions. This data can help you refine your onboarding process and identify any stumbling blocks users might be encountering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on driving users toward key actions, you help them experience your product&#8217;s value quickly, increasing the likelihood of long-term engagement and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to measure and optimize user onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure your onboarding process is effective, you need to measure its performance and continuously optimize it. This involves tracking specific metrics and collecting user feedback. Let&#8217;s explore the key metrics to track and how to collect valuable data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key metrics to track</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Time to Value (TTV):</strong> This measures how quickly users experience the core value of your product. A shorter TTV often leads to better user retention. To measure TTV, track the time from sign-up to when users complete key actions that represent value realization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engagement rate:</strong> This metric shows the percentage of users actively using your product after onboarding. A high engagement rate indicates a successful onboarding strategy. Analyze user activity logs to determine the proportion of active users over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer churn:</strong> Churn rate measures how many users stop using your product after onboarding. A high churn rate may indicate problems with your onboarding process. Calculate the percentage of users who discontinue use within a defined period post-onboarding.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feature adoption rate:</strong> This tracks how many users engage with key features of your product. It helps you understand which features are being utilized and which may need better onboarding support. Monitor user interactions with specific features to calculate the adoption rate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User satisfaction:</strong> This qualitative metric provides insights into users&#8217; experiences and areas for improvement. Use surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores post-onboarding to gauge user satisfaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to collect data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To gather the necessary data for these metrics, consider the following methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analytics tools: </strong>Use platforms like <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Analytics</a>, <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mixpanel</a>, or <a href=\"https://amplitude.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amplitude</a> to track user behavior. Set up event tracking to monitor key actions during onboarding. Analyze funnel reports to understand where users are dropping off and which steps are most effective.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mixpanel-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Mixpanel homepage and example analytics board\" class=\"wp-image-2149\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Customer feedback:</strong> Conduct surveys using tools like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SurveyMonkey</a> or <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Typeform</a> to gather user opinions on the onboarding experience. Implement NPS and CSAT surveys to measure overall satisfaction. Use in-app feedback tools to collect real-time insights from users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/survey-monkey-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Survey Monkey homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2150\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User interviews:</strong> Conduct one-on-one interviews with a diverse sample of users. These provide deeper insights into the onboarding experience and can uncover issues that might not be apparent from quantitative data alone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heatmaps and session recordings: </strong>Tools like <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hotjar</a> or <a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crazy Egg</a> can help you visualize how users interact with your onboarding process. Analyze these to identify areas where users struggle or spend more time than expected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hotjar-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Hotjar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2151\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal of collecting this data is to continually improve your onboarding process. Regularly review your metrics and user feedback to identify areas for optimization. Look for patterns in user behavior and feedback that suggest where improvements can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you notice a high drop-off rate at a particular step in your onboarding process, investigate why users might be struggling at that point. Are the instructions unclear? Is the step too complex? Use this insight to refine and simplify that part of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Integrate Gravatar to improve your onboarding experience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve covered a lot about making your onboarding process better.

This was announced by the Automattic-sponsored developer Dion Hulse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning next month, WordPress.org will make two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory for all plugin and theme authors. Authors can configure 2FA by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/profile/security.\">visiting their WordPress.org profiles</a>, and the platform has already started prompting them to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dion Hulse emphasized the importance of securely storing backup codes, as losing access to both 2FA methods and backup codes could complicate account recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SVN Passwords for Commit Access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org will also introduce SVN passwords for committing changes to plugins and themes. This feature separates commit access from the main WordPress.org account credentials, offering an extra layer of security. Authors can generate SVN passwords through their profiles, ensuring that their main account passwords are protected. Those using deployment scripts, like GitHub Actions, will need to update their stored passwords with these new SVN credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those wondering why the Plugin Review Team is not using 2FA with SVN, Dion explained, “Due to technical limitations, 2FA cannot be applied to our existing code repositories, that’s why we’ve chosen to secure WordPress.org code through a combination of account-level two-factor authentication, high-entropy SVN passwords, and other deploy-time security features (such as &nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/release-confirmation-emails/\">Release Confirmations</a>).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, authors can refer to the guides on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/tutorials-guides/configuring-two-factor-authentication/\">Configuring Two-Factor Authentication</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/tutorials-guides/svn-access/\">Subversion Access</a> and Chris Christoff’s post on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2024/06/26/keeping-your-plugin-committer-accounts-secure/\">Keeping Your Plugin Committer Accounts Secure</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Reaction&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The community has reacted positively to these changes, with some expressing that these updates were long overdue. “At least we were earlier than someone stepping on Mars, &#8221; joked developer Toma Todua.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the WordPress Plugin Team has ramped up efforts to enhance platform security. In June, they temporarily halted plugin releases and forced all plugin authors to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2024/06/29/password-reset-required-for-plugin-authors/\">reset their passwords</a> after five WordPress.org user accounts were compromised.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 20:12:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Key Insights From WooCommerce Survey 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161147\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/key-insights-from-woocommerce-survey-2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3340:\"<p>WooCommerce has unveiled the results of its <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/black-friday-trends/\">2024 summer survey</a>, shedding light on how store owners, developers, and partners gear up for Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) and the holiday shopping rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the key takeaways from the survey:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BFCM Sales Account for a Major Share of Annual Revenue</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BFCM plays a crucial role for online merchants, contributing to approximately 30%-50% of their yearly sales. The survey revealed that 66% of stores reported increased sales during the holiday season, highlighting its significance for businesses. In fact, for some stores, up to 50% of their annual revenue comes from this period alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>46% of stores see up to 30% of their yearly sales during this time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>26% generate over 30% of their annual sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8% surpass 50% of annual sales during BFCM.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stores &amp; Early Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger stores with annual revenues of $250K+ are 12% more likely to begin preparations early. In total, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/black-friday-trends/\">81% of stores actively plan</a> for BFCM promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>26% of stores begin planning 1-4 weeks before BFCM.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27% start preparations 1-3 months ahead.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13% dedicate 3-6 months to preparation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4% start more than 6 months in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preparation Tactics &amp; Strategies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>26% of stores planned to increase inventory as their primary preparation strategy. This was followed by marketing, promotions, and website optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to marketing channels:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>29% of stores find email the most effective, followed by organic social media (25%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other popular channels include paid social (13%), search ads (8%), and content marketing (6%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 2024 holiday season, 34% of stores are adjusting their strategies, focusing on: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Introducing new products (26%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improving marketing efforts (24%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhancing website performance (16%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting sales early (10%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering special discounts (9%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making changes to customer engagement, social media, and inventory management completes the list.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multi-Channel Sales </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey also noted that 67% of stores sell through multiple channels, including physical locations and online marketplaces. Specifically, 11% of stores sell on Amazon, 8% sell on Etsy and 6% sell on eBay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customer Engagement &amp; Analytics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant 91% of stores use analytics tools like Google Analytics, WooCommerce Analytics Dashboard, and Meteorik to evaluate campaign performance.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enhancing WordPress learning experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Jonathan Bossenger. Jonathan based in Cape town, South Africa, has been an integral part of the WordPress community for nearly a decade. Transitioning from software development to web, and then WordPress development, he found his passion in education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since attending his first word camp in 2015, he has focused on creating educational content for WordPress developers. Now employed at Automattic as a developer educator, he contributes to the Learn platform, helping to train and guide new developers in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s on the podcast today to explain some of the ways that you can learn WordPress with up to date, freely available content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the goal of making WordPress learning accessible globally, especially for those who can&#8217;t afford expensive courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion gets into the transformative potential of the Learn WordPress platform, especially in the era of Playground, which will enable interactive coding practice without the need for external tools. Jonathan sees this as a game changer for web agencies, providing a streamlined training resource for new developers and conserving valuable time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover Jonathan&#8217;s journey from software developer to developer educator, supported by his former employer, Castos. He shares the challenges of keeping educational content current amidst WordPress&#8217;s rapid evolution, and the importance of staying updated with WordPress core developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touches on the structured learning pathways, designed to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels. Segmented into user designer and developer categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The professionalism of WordPress projects like Learn, and the essential role of contributors in translating and internationalising content to reach a broader audience ,comes under the microscope as well. And Jonathan reflects upon the dynamic nature of open source communities, stressing the need for decisive leadership in software development decisions from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about the many ways that you can assist the Learn project, and there are many more ways than you might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how people learn about WordPress, and how you can be a part of that project, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jonathan Bossenger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today, once more by Jonathan Bossenger. Hey, Jonathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Hello, I&#8217;m back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about a really important subject, and a subject which I think is getting more importance. We can get into the politics or what have you of that in a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin the conversation all about Learn, and what&#8217;s going on over there, Jonathan, for those people who don&#8217;t know who you are, do you want to just give us your brief potted history? Maybe your current job, and your history with WordPress and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:24] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. So for those who don&#8217;t know, my name is Jonathan Bossenger. I live in Cape Town in South Africa, which is the country right at the tip of Africa. I have been involved in the WordPress community now for about nine years. I went to my first WordCamp in Cape Town in 2015, and I am a web developer, originally a software developer, then a web developer, then a WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m now transitioned to this wonderful new thing that I call, or at least people call developer educator. I&#8217;m currently employed at Automattic, I&#8217;m sponsored to work full-time with the WordPress training team, and my job is basically creating educational content for WordPress developers. So everything that is on Learn, that has to do with WordPress development, I have got some hand in somewhere there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Was this a pivot that you kind of had as part of your north star five or six years ago, or is this very much an evolution that kind of happened to you without it meaning to be the case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I did pivot from software development to developer education kind of organically, but also with a little bit of support. You&#8217;ll appreciate the story, Nathan. So as you will know, I was working at Castos for a number of years. I was the initial developer that Craig hired when we first kicked Castos off. I became lead developer as the company grew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in conversations that I had with Craig, as my CEO, as the company grew, and as we run about the time the TinySeed thing happened and Craig had some money that he could spend to grow the team and all those things. He sat me down and he said to me, right, what does the future look like for you? As the company grows, we&#8217;ve got potential to get big, what does the future look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he said the word engineering manager, and the term CTO came up, and I realised in those conversations that that was not what I wanted to be doing. As much as I enjoyed developing software, I&#8217;m not great at leading people. I have a very short temper, I struggle to lead properly, and part of it is also just I&#8217;ve never had good experience under other good leaders, and that was part of my journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I really do enjoy doing, and you&#8217;ll appreciate this, I enjoy educating folks about content, about things, about GPL, about whatever. And I really enjoy teaching other developers, mentoring them, guiding them through a journey. And at the time I shared this information with Craig, he said to me, well, funnily enough there&#8217;s this role at Delicious Brains. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know Delicious Brains, WP Migrate, and all those plugins. And they were looking for specifically a developer educator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sat on that job posting for about a year and a half before I eventually applied. But that was the sort of transition of that process, going from full-time software developer to developer educator. And that process is what landed me up where I am today because I enjoy teaching WordPress, I enjoy teaching WordPress development. I discovered the training team through a series of events. And so when the role, when the position became available to do this full time, I grabbed it with both hands, and that&#8217;s where I am now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are an Automattician, you work for Automattic now, yeah. And you are a hundred percent on creating educational materials, that is all that you are involved in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That is what my role is within the company, but I also do jump in here and there all over the place because I am a full-time volunteer, if you will, I&#8217;m a lifelong volunteer. So I do try and get involved with Core wherever I can. I try and help with the docs wherever I can because the docs, especially the developer docs, they inform a lot of my content that we create for Learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I find issues in the docs, I&#8217;ll try and update those. After about a year and a half of pestering folks, eventually they gave me access to the docs, and I can just make whatever changes I need to. And I do treat that with a lot of respect, and I only make changes that I think are really obvious. Or I check with folks first and make sure that those changes make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my employment at Automattic is specifically to work with the training team, to help drive the Learn WordPress platform forward, primarily creating content, helping with the platform, helping with the code base. Bringing in other collaborators, working with other collaborators, supporting them, and just helping to make Learn WordPress the best place to learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, nice. I guess if you have the calling to be an educator, and some people do and some people don&#8217;t, I know plenty of people who really enjoy the work that they do as educators, be it of children, online, or what have you. If you have that calling, it is profoundly meaningful, isn&#8217;t it? If you have that in you, that you wish to educate other people, I think there&#8217;s a deep sense of satisfaction and meaning that comes from that, and significance that comes from that. So I hope it&#8217;s fulfilling you on that level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, interesting in the bit that you just said, you&#8217;re dipping in and out. Because I guess, if you are going to be teaching people about WordPress, and given what Learn covers, and we&#8217;ll get into all of that, you can&#8217;t become de-skilled, can you? It&#8217;s not like you could sit making courses five years from now, without being absolutely knee deep in the weeds of the project as a whole, because won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. You won&#8217;t know what to make courses about. You won&#8217;t understand the new UI that&#8217;s coming down the pike, and all of that kind of thing. So I guess the two things go hand in hand, you have to keep up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Absolutely. I have learned more about WordPress Core in the last two years that I&#8217;ve been teaching it, than I ever have in the nine years before that I was using it and building on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s that very common saying about, to really understand a topic, teach it. Because you can only teach someone something if you really understand. And so I am challenged even with some of the older stuff. I was doing a series of lessons recently about how to extend user capabilities, and I went down a massive rabbit hole about how this all actually works. I&#8217;ve used it in the past as a plugin developer when I was working at Castos, and for projects and whatever. I&#8217;ve assigned capabilities, I&#8217;ve created custom capabilities, but I&#8217;ve never understood how they really just work. I&#8217;ve just gone, yeah, they work, and I&#8217;ve moved on with my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have to understand deeply how they work, before I can teach somebody. So this is the interesting thing about WordPress is there is so much to learn. There is so much historical information, there is so much in Core that will continue forever, that there is to learn. And then as you say, there&#8217;s so much new stuff coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new stuff is a whole topic on its own, and we&#8217;ll definitely chat about that in a second. But yeah, there&#8217;s just so much to learn and to then teach that I feel like, I&#8217;ve always said I&#8217;ve never been the best developer, there are folks out there who are way better developers than I am, there are architects and whatever else. But I&#8217;ve always had this desire to share knowledge and teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I get the best of both worlds. I get to dive into Core, I get to dig into the code, I get to understand how it works. I get to find bugs and report them if something&#8217;s wonky while I&#8217;m preparing a lesson. And then I get to share that with others, and help them figure out how this stuff all works, I do all the fumbling, and then I present the lesson, and off they go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> With the kind of teaching that you do, so I have several friends in the real world who live close to me who teach children in schools. And the feedback there is immediate, you teach the content, and then you&#8217;re either staring a bunch of happy faces, or there&#8217;s confusion on the face, and so you realise, okay, I pitched that incorrectly. The whole online content thing, I don&#8217;t understand how the feedback works there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, we spoke about it being a meaningful thing, and I think probably if you&#8217;re a classroom teacher, the meaning is the faces. You know, you see the impression that you are having on the children. You can see that, okay, that child who didn&#8217;t get that yesterday now gets it, and there&#8217;s that it immediate feedback loop, which must be beautiful. But what does that look like for online content? How do you even get feedback about, okay, that worked, or that was good, or no, redo that? How does that happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> There&#8217;s a couple of ways that does happen for me at least. The one way is that we have got feedback processes in our content on Learn WordPress. So there is a feedback form linked at the bottom of most lessons. The end of every course we&#8217;re implementing a feedback survey. But we also do things that allow more direct feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something that we kicked off last year for the first time, we ran one last year, we are planning on running two this year, we just finished the first one, was this concept of a in-person course cohort. So we take a series of content, and then we invite learners to come along on a journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s asynchronous communication, but then we, once a week we have a synchronous call where everybody who&#8217;s available gets together, and we chat through the content. And in those spaces I get to interact with the students directly. I get to see the successes. I get to see the difficulties and try and help them with the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also get to see the students, or the learners, helping each other out. And so in all of those spaces I get that sort of reinforce, okay, wow, this is working, this isn&#8217;t working, seeing this successful, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also, interestingly, with the way we create content, we have a review process. So when a new lesson is ready to be published, we will upload it to the GitHub issue, we manage everything in GitHub. We&#8217;ll upload it to the GitHub issue, and then we will ask members of the training team to review the content. And so they&#8217;re basically getting like a preview of the content before it gets published live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of the folks who do the reviews are subject matter experts in that area. So if it&#8217;s a thing about developing a plugin, or developing a block, or whatever. It&#8217;ll be block developers, and plugin developers, and theme developers who review the content. And they will give you direct feedback as well. And they will say, oh, this works, ooh, I learned this today. And so you&#8217;ll get those little nuggets here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have a lot of great feedback. I&#8217;d love to get more, and we&#8217;re working on processes to get more, and more, and more feedback. Because the more interactions we can have with learners, the more we can see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s definitely a big part of the whole redesign, and the relaunch that we&#8217;ve been working on, is creating spaces for that feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. Let&#8217;s get into the content itself. So it occurs to me that we&#8217;ve got this far into the episode and we haven&#8217;t actually mentioned the URL, which is a bit remiss. So head to learn.wordpress.org, and from there you can go in all sorts of directions, and you&#8217;ll be able to see that. The UI may change, it has undergone some changes recently as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in an ideal world, we&#8217;d go to that website, and we would have any question about WordPress, and we would find the answer. That would be a utopia, some sort of crazy universe that we don&#8217;t live in, where everything that we could possibly want, there&#8217;s a piece of content which will address that question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not the reality. You have to pick and choose your subjects. At this moment in history, we&#8217;re in July 2024, how are those decisions made? How do you make the decision, okay, this is the next tranche of content that we&#8217;re going to make? Ignore what you&#8217;ve already got. How are you making decisions about what comes next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So that is very much driven by the learners themselves. And you mentioned about ignore the content you&#8217;ve got, but the content that we&#8217;ve got is actually very important to think about because it informed where we are currently. So at the end of, I think it was the end of 2021, or 2022, I can&#8217;t remember exactly what year, but the training team, so the WordPress training team, these are the folks that are similar to the Core team, or the Meta team, we all know those teams in Slack, and all the different teams on the Make Blogs. The training team is the team that focuses on everything on Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They did a individual learner feedback survey. They tried to reach all folks who have accessed Learn content since its inception in 2020. And they said, give us your feedback. What is working, what is not working? And the biggest piece of feedback we got out of that learner survey was more structured learning pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that stage, the content was very scattershot. We were creating the content that we thought was good, so when I joined Automattic as a full-time sponsored contributor, and I looked at the developer focused content there, I went, well, there&#8217;s nothing about WordPress hooks. That&#8217;s probably one of the first things that you need to learn about if you&#8217;re going to develop with WordPress. So I created a series of lessons on WordPress hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I went, well, what is the next thing I want to create? There was no structure, there was no plan. And so learning pathways became the thing that folks wanted the most. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focusing on right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Could you just clear up what pathways means? Because I suspect it might be a word which isn&#8217;t entirely familiar to everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> A hundred percent. And I didn&#8217;t know what a learning pathway was before I got started, to be honest. But in our scope, in our space, when we talk about a learning pathway, we mean a specifically structured series of modules and lessons that take you from point 1 to point 5, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We defined a series of learning pathways, the first are all user focused. So we have a beginner user learning pathway, and it&#8217;s basically the introduction to WordPress. You&#8217;ve never used WordPress before. What are pages? What are posts? How do I set the homepage instead of the blog home? All those kind of beginner situations. So you can go from knowing nothing about WordPress, to having a pretty good idea about how WordPress works, and you can put your site together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have the next level which is, now you understand how WordPress works, now how do we go deeper? Maybe, how do themes work? How do themes get installed, and how do they work within your WordPress sites, or plugins, or those kind of things? How you can build forms. What options you have. What are plugins, and where do I find them? And those kind of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the developer side we had a similar thing, we said, right, let&#8217;s imagine somebody who&#8217;s now gone through all the user learning pathways, and they can use WordPress successfully, but now they want to go a step further. They want to start customising WordPress beyond what the no code tools allow. How do they start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they first need to start and understand what HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL are, and JavaScript, and we need to give them an introduction to that. So we kind of, we define these learning pathways as a structured way of progressing from point A to point Z, say, within a specific realm. Be it user, designer. And we specifically isolated user, designer and developer, because those were kind of our, what we saw as our three big user stories, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the pathways are kind of structured content. You begin at, if you like, lesson one, and you go through 3, 4, 5, 6, all the way up to 20 or what have you. And so, when you come out of that, at the end, you&#8217;ve acquired a body of learning. It feels like an LMS, a learning management system is kind of how it&#8217;s all held together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you log into the UI, you can see that you&#8217;ve completed this lesson, you&#8217;re up to lesson five, okay, clearly lesson six comes next. And if you complete one pathway, is there some intention that one pathway will then lead to another pathway, if you like? So if you complete the beginner bit, then a logical step would be to go to this next pathway, so that everything is sort of like a big spider web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Exactly that. So, for example, if we think about it, let&#8217;s go to brand new user, they come in, they start with the beginner user pathway. They finish that. Then from there, do they want to go further into the user side of things, and there&#8217;s a link to the next level pathway, and they can go through that. Or do they want to get into development? And then that links them to the beginner developer learning pathway. So depending on what type of scenario they have, they can then choose to go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then additionally, if I just focus on, let&#8217;s say the beginner developer learning pathway. So in the beginner developer learning pathway we introduce the concepts of the web languages, and web servers, and all that kind of thing. And then we talk about an introduction to plugins. And at the end of the plugins module, well, what if they want to go further into plugin development? Then there will be a plugin developer learning pathway. And that&#8217;s all focusing on plugin developments, and all the things you would need to learn for plugin development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say they don&#8217;t want to do that, they continue along beginner developer. The next one, actually it&#8217;s the other way around, it&#8217;s theme first, then plugin. So they do theme, then plugin. At the end of the theme module, what if they want to go deeper into themes? Then there&#8217;s a link to the theme developer learning pathway. So they could either carry on with beginner, and just wrap that up, and get a broad understanding of sort of WordPress development, or they could choose to dive in deeper. And once they finished, for example, theme developer, they could come back, and then go through plugin developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do envision, as you say, the sort of spider web. At the moment, everything is very one lane. So it&#8217;s sort of beginner user, intermediate user, advanced user. The same for developer, the same for designer. But once all this content is created, then we can start thinking about how, sort of getting an idea of where people go and what they want to learn, and trying to tie these things in together so that, whichever path they take, there&#8217;s content for them to get to an eventual goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned earlier that there were real world conversations that you had. So i&#8217;ll just use the word Zoom for want of a better word. So you get on a Zoom call once a month. Do they fit into these learning pathways? So, for example, if I was to join the, oh I don&#8217;t know, the beginner WordPress one. I&#8217;m absolutely new to WordPress, I just want learn how to install it, and what a post is, and what a page is, and all of that kind of stuff. Is there any kind of Zoom call for that, or are we on our own? Does every pathway have its sort of dedicated time, or is it just all the pathways on the Zoom call at the same moment? How does that all work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:54] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So as I mentioned, the course cohorts, the Zoom calls, they&#8217;re something that&#8217;s very new that we&#8217;ve kind of started experimenting with. So the first one we ran, I basically, I created a separate course for it, because we were doing it over a period of six weeks, so one call per week. So we essentially had to have enough content for somebody to kind of work on on a week by week basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also had to think about, well, how much time do folks actually have after their day jobs and whatever else to work on this content? So we tried to make sure that what they were working on could be done within about two to three hours. So they could do it on a Saturday morning if they&#8217;re working a day job, or an evening or whatever the case is. And so we created a separate course for that to work through. Work out the kinks, figure out how it&#8217;s all going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal is to actually, with the next time we do a course cohort, is to actually take the folks through a set of modules in a specific learning pathway. So what I&#8217;m envisioning for, and because I&#8217;m focused on developers, what I&#8217;m envisioning for my next course cohort is to take, and I know you shared the beginner developer learning pathway in a previous podcast. But to take folks through maybe the first six, possibly six modules, because I think there&#8217;s 12 in total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first six modules of the beginner developer learning pathway, which will cover an introduction to WordPress, and web servers, and how it works. The five programming languages. An introduction to plugins, themes, and blocks. So that&#8217;ll give them a good base, a good foundation to start from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from there, if they choose to continue along that pathway on their own, they&#8217;re more than welcome to. But then what I would like to be able to do is, the next time we run a course cohort, I invite those folks back for part two. And we then take them on the next six, and we take them through that process. So that&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m envisioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to kind of be interesting to manage because eventually I&#8217;m going to be in a situation where I&#8217;m running one cohort for the first six and one cohort for the second six, because the previous first six are coming back for the second six, and I&#8217;m going to be cycling around like that. So I&#8217;m going to need folks to help me facilitate those, I can&#8217;t just do it all myself. And that&#8217;s part of what we do as well. But that&#8217;s kind of the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a nice endeavor, isn&#8217;t it? So almost recycling the knowledge through the people that been through the program. So the beginners of yesteryear are the ones who are training the beginnings of next year, if you know what I mean. Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. Yeah, this lovely sort of feedback loop. That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> And we actually had someone, sorry to interrupt you, we actually someone from the last cohort who actually has stepped up and said he would like to help facilitate the next one. So I&#8217;m hoping to invite him along for the next one that we kick off, so that he can maybe facilitate that and I can be more in a support role, so that he can then continue along. So that&#8217;s hopefully where this goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We have a lot of commercial courses online. You don&#8217;t have to Google too much to discover that there&#8217;s dozens probably, maybe hundreds, I don&#8217;t know, of courses online where this is the person&#8217;s job, if you like. They sell the course, you pay for access for a period of time, you use an LMS and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that way you have this intuition, I guess that, okay, I&#8217;ve paid for it, hopefully it&#8217;s going to be updated and rah, rah, rah. But this, we should have pointed out probably before, there&#8217;s no cost to any of this to the end user. How does that work? Obviously there&#8217;s a lot of volunteer work, you are an Automattician so you are seconded to do this work. How does it all, I mean, it can&#8217;t be free, it can be free at the point of use, but it can&#8217;t be free to create. How does it afford to exist? How can that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:03] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I mean it&#8217;s as simple as Five for the Future. And I&#8217;ve publicly said this. When I joined Automattic I went and checked, and 5% of Automattic staff are working on WordPress Core. So Automattic puts its money where its mouth is. And the great thing about that is that, by doing that we make the learning content as free and open source as the software itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to just say this upfront, I have a great love and respect for anybody creating educational content for any kind of product, service, whatever, on their own. It is not something I could do. I am very fortunate that I get paid a regular salary to do this. And a few people have said to me, you could probably earn so much more if you did this on your own. And they&#8217;re probably right, but it&#8217;s just not within my brain space to be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have great respect for folks who can do this on their own and make a living out of it. And I love the fact that all these options exist because what I teach, and what someone like Fränk Klein, or Nyasha Green, they&#8217;re all folks who have got courses online that are either free or paid. What they teach and what I teach are all from our subjective viewpoint. So it&#8217;s based on our experiences, based on our knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I encourage folks to try out these different courses if they can afford to do them, because you&#8217;re going to get pieces of information that you wouldn&#8217;t get from someone like myself, because of different levels of experience, different backgrounds, different interests, whatever. But what I want to be able to do is I want to be able to make it possible so that folks who can&#8217;t afford to learn these things, students, folks in third world countries, can go online and get something. That&#8217;s my goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they come to Learn WordPress, and they learn the basics, and then they go off and learn and pay for another course because they get hired a job, and that job pays for them to learn somewhere else, I am happy. Because ultimately that is the goal of democratising something. You know, we democratise publishing by building this open source software, and making it possible for companies to earn money off it. So I want to democratise WordPress learning and make it possible for folks to learn what they need to do to get a job, and then be able to pay for other courses and increase their learning that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think lucky is the wrong word, but when I was going through on another podcast that I do, when I was just explaining that some of these courses were coming around, you know, the introduction to WordPress course, and the developer course and what have you that have dropped in the last few months. I just felt an enormous sense of, oh I don&#8217;t know, privilege or luck that that&#8217;s all there. That anybody on the planet who has the capacity to connect to the internet, does have the capacity to learn WordPress completely for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, you may go off in different directions, and Learn is bound to the WordPress project itself, you know, it&#8217;s not going to explore this page builder, or that page builder because that&#8217;s out of the bounds. But what a privilege to just roll into web development as a project, you know, maybe it&#8217;s a hobby at the moment, and find a bunch of really credible resources online, and then think to yourself, okay, where&#8217;s the checkout? There&#8217;s no checkout. It&#8217;s just completely for free. And that is, that&#8217;s miraculous, frankly. And it could not have been that way, but it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> It is, absolutely. And the way I always look at this is, you talk about other page builders, and let&#8217;s talk about other plugins, and other themes, and whatever the case may be. We talk about perfect utopias. What I would love to see is a world where agency X, you know, Human Made, all these web agencies, I&#8217;m just mentioning names, XWP, 10up, all of those. They&#8217;ve got new developers coming in, junior developers coming in, and instead of them having to build, hire somebody, or pay somebody to make content for internal training, they can just link them off to Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then those folks can go through the training and then be productive members of that team. And then that person who&#8217;s creating the content can do something else for the company, can create other content that the company needs, as opposed to having to recreate this educational content all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve had conversations with hosting companies. You know, hosting companies, they have video editors who have to both create educational videos for customers, but also promotional videos and all that to grow the company. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if they could just focus on their promotional videos and grow the company, and send customers links to Learn WordPress? They don&#8217;t even have to send them links to Learn WordPress, it&#8217;s as open source as the software. So everything we release is creative commons essentially, because that&#8217;s the text video version of open source software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if they want to include it in their customer support portals, all of our videos are on YouTube, so folks could link to it from YouTube if they want to. Imagine how much opportunity it creates for them to use those folks for other things, for growing the business, for customer interactions, or whatever the case may be. As opposed to having to recreate the wheel every time, because every hosting company needs to create support videos. Every hosting company needs to create a, this is pages, this is posts, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really nice idea. I&#8217;m going to go off piste for just a moment, and I don&#8217;t want to go down this alley particularly, but also, if you go to some of the courses, I&#8217;m going to coin a phrase, they are Playgroundable. You can click a button, the button at the moment says, practice with WordPress Playground. And if you&#8217;re not familiar with that button, just go and click it and hold your breath for about two seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll basically get a functioning website inside the browser with the course content there, all of the bits and pieces that are mentioned. So that impediment, even the impediment of, okay, go download something like Local. Install WordPress. Now do this, do that. Make sure these settings are all configured. Even that headache is gone, and that is just utterly remarkable. I don&#8217;t know if you want to just quickly get into that, but how amazing is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Absolutely. Matt said this at his summer update, pay attention to Playground. So I just want to mention, you talk about the practice with WordPress Playground button. That button doesn&#8217;t yet load up the Playground instance with all the course content. But there&#8217;s currently a conversation that I&#8217;m actively involved in, and have been for the last few weeks, where we&#8217;re going to make that possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am able to load up the code example, for example, of the lesson that I&#8217;m working on in a Playground block inside the lesson. And folks can physically code inside the window and see the changes on the preview. And then there&#8217;s a button where you can open that in a new tab and it goes full screen in your laptop, or your computer, or whatever. And you can just live code it there, see the changes, see what breaks, see the debug output. And then there&#8217;s a button to download that code to your machine so that you can upload it to GitHub or wherever you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground is going to change the way we teach WordPress to folks, and I can&#8217;t wait for it to be, it&#8217;s like 99% there. There&#8217;s a few tweaks we&#8217;re busy making to get it there. There&#8217;s also quite a bit of work we&#8217;ve been working on with accessibility of Playground. You probably know Alex Stein, he&#8217;s been helping us test that, so massive thanks to him, so that there&#8217;s no accessibility issues. So yes, when the relaunch happens at the end of this month, beginning of this month, I&#8217;m hoping that that&#8217;s all going to be in place. And then as you&#8217;re sitting there reading through the lesson or watching the video, and you want to try this out, as you say, you click a button, it opens a tab, and you just code, and you just see it do its thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s properly profound. I remember when I first saw Playground, I actually didn&#8217;t make the mental leap to what it could do. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure many people did. Adam Zielinski did. The rest of us were sort of caught short a little bit, but I thought, oh, that&#8217;s novel, that&#8217;s interesting. But it feels to me as if the education piece, not just tied to WordPress, but in schools, in universities, in colleges, that seems to be one of the most useful things. You know, that ability to, okay, we want to teach you something, okay, you want all the resources, click that button, there they are, right there. And it&#8217;ll be fascinating to see how that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:14] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Very quickly, before we wrap this up, I just want to share a story. I remember at a previous WordCamp in Cape Town we did a kids camp. And all we wanted to do was teach kids what WordPress is and how you use it. We spent the whole morning just getting them to install a local development environment and getting a WordPress install set up. So that&#8217;s half a day lost. Now you don&#8217;t have that half a day. You just dive straight in, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And also probably the interest as well. You know, you&#8217;ll have lost a few kids along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:37] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> We did. Half of them lost it halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Anyway, so keep your eye on Playground, and also I&#8217;ll link to the episode that I did with Adam Zielinski. The problem with that episode is it goes out of date like in a heart beat because everything&#8217;s changing so quick. Which actually leads me nicely to that question in terms of Learn. Because in the last five, six years, WordPress has changed phenomenally, but it feels like that pace of change, especially in the last year, has gone even more critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI is about to change entirely for massive part, well, in fact has in many ways, but is about to undergo major changes. How do you keep up with all of this? And I mean obviously you do it by doing the work, but that must be a constant kind of thorn in the side of a project like Learn, because you release a piece of content and then six weeks later, oh okay, that no longer works, we&#8217;ve got to go back. So it must be this constant cycle of check that it&#8217;s still working, okay, remake the videos, try to slot it in somewhere, make sure all the links are working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:38] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I will say that this is one area where the learning pathways sort of project that we have now, and the learning pathway itself is essentially just a course in an LMS. And I think you mentioned this in the last podcast, we&#8217;re using Sensei underneath. But it&#8217;s just a really big course. In the past we&#8217;ve had courses which were like four or five lessons and that was the course. Now we&#8217;re talking about 50 lessons or whatever, broken down into modules with activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But structurally it&#8217;s just a course. It&#8217;s nothing special, but it&#8217;s a course with a very specific goal. And so one of the things that we try and do is we try and isolate specific topics within each module, and then within each lesson with each module, we try and isolate even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience has been that a lot of what I&#8217;m teaching is foundational software development within WordPress, which doesn&#8217;t really change much. That having been said, there&#8217;s a contributor that I&#8217;ve been working with, Cynthia Norman, you might know her, she&#8217;s from Canada. She recently won the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship to WordCamp US. She has been working with me on the theme developer learning pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the process of that thing, so we started working on that at about the beginning of this year. And in the process of that, we had a number of things pop up here and there that have changed. My general attitude about these things, and this might be because I&#8217;m a developer primarily, an educator second to that. But my general attitude about these things is that, even though something has changed, the core content is still useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it does require you to maybe overlook some UI change. Maybe a button is a different text, or it&#8217;s in a place, or whatever. But underneath it all, it&#8217;s all more or less the same. My colleague Wes, also an Automattician, also sponsored to work with the training team, focusing on the user facing side, he has a much harder time, because things change a lot more drastically for him than what they do for me. But his advantage there is his courses, his learning pathways are a little bit shorter than mine because there&#8217;s not so much in depth technical knowledge that he needs to present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, it is a realistic thing. It&#8217;s a conversation we have many, many, many, times, and we&#8217;ve kind of settled on, we will fix it in post, if you will. So we wait for somebody, as much as we can, we wait for somebody to report the issue and then we fix it when it&#8217;s reported. That might seem a little bit silly to some folks, but ultimately that&#8217;s our advantage with the fact that we don&#8217;t rely on the income of the sale of these courses to be able to get folks learning them. So if it&#8217;s not super, super up to date, it&#8217;s not the end of the world really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where I say I respect folks who are having to keep super, super up to date, because if they don&#8217;t, then people don&#8217;t pay for their courses. So that&#8217;s our little bit of an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still have people coming back to me today, I did two courses on Block Themes. Developers Guide to Block Themes in 2022, and that is now 3, 4, 5 versions out of date. But I still have people coming back to me and saying, this was still valuable because it gave me the core foundational knowledge that I didn&#8217;t have, and then I could just build on top of that. So I don&#8217;t see that to be a huge problem. We just need to, when we&#8217;re planning these things, we do need to be aware of them. We do need to be fairly reactive when things do get picked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s great is we have Anne McCarthy working with us. So Anne McCarthy is one of our subject matter experts in the training team. And she will often, when she sees a change coming, she will tag us. And so there&#8217;s actually one lesson in the beginner developer learning pathway that I&#8217;m going to be editing this week. Because Anne tagged a change that was coming in, I think 6.6, and I&#8217;m going to be editing it this week to make that difference. So we do have those kind of feedback loops, which is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. It just all speaks to the whole thing, there&#8217;s a cohesion there. And that kind of leads me into this next thing, and it feels as if, I don&#8217;t really know how to encapsulate this in a question, it&#8217;s maybe more just an opinion. But it does feel like projects like Learn, so learn.wordpress.org, or we&#8217;ll just call it Learn, have got a much more, air quotes, I&#8217;m doing air quotes, professional thing about them. That&#8217;s not a particularly well worded question. Let me try that again. It feels like, things like Learn are more professional now than they were before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that what was before was unprofessional, but it does seem like there is more focus on making things utterly complete. You know, look professional from the outset. Have a nice UI. Have a nice UX. All of those things being taken into consideration. Is it just me? Is that just coincidence? Or is there some sort of imperative to make things look, and again, air quotes, enterprise ready. Is there something going on there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:45] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So I would say that the phrase is not enterprise ready, but the phrase you could think about as, let&#8217;s do great work. This is public information. So you might remember there was some kerfuffle a while back on the Core, the Make Core blog about the redesign of the WordPress.org landing page. And Matt was quite vocal about the fact that sometimes design by committee doesn&#8217;t work. Sometimes somebody needs to make a decision and take a stance and say, this is the way we&#8217;re going, this is the way we&#8217;re doing things because this will take us to where we need to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember vividly when I went to my first WordCamp Europe in 2018 in Serbia, I was still working as a freelancer at the time, I wasn&#8217;t even working at Castos yet. I was working as a freelancer at Codeable, and I had the opportunity to travel to WorldCamp Europe. You might remember, you actually messaged me in Slack and said, is that you asking a question? Because I think you saw me on the YouTube stream or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I did, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:31] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That was the first time I got to ask a question of Matt ever in my life. And my question to him was, why the block editor? Why are we doing all of this? And I mean I wasn&#8217;t an Automattician at the time, I was just a freelance WordPress developer contributing to the project where I could. And the answer that he gave me that day kind of stuck with me. And he said, what brought us to where we are now is not going to take us to where we need to go. And that is kind of what all of this is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve never had this conversation with Matt, my CEO, around this. This is still back to when I was still, this is Matt, my BDFL. But I&#8217;ve always felt that it&#8217;s interesting, I come from PHP based open source software. So my experience of open source communities was largely framed by the communities I was involved in, which was the PHP community, the Cake PHP community, and the Laravel community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those communities, the founder, the creator of the software, the BDFL, whatever you want to call them, has a very distinct and controlling voice. If you look at the Laravel software, Taylor Otwell says, this is what we&#8217;re doing. And he doesn&#8217;t ask for anybody&#8217;s opinions. He says, this is what we&#8217;re doing, and this is the way we&#8217;re going to go forward. And nobody shouts about it. Nobody complains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t have a voice and we shouldn&#8217;t have opinions, but I do believe in any software, open source or closed, or otherwise, there needs to be somebody who makes a final choice. There needs to be a captain of the ship. And sometimes we need to disagree with the captain&#8217;s decision, but commit to whatever the vision is and see if it works. And sometimes we just need to let the captain make the decision and hope for the best. Sometimes it&#8217;s going to work out, sometimes it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do feel like, and again, this is not something I&#8217;ve been impressed upon internally or otherwise. I do feel like Matt has decided he wants to sort of take the ship in a certain direction, because he believes that this is the right direction for the ship, and the redesign is part of that. You may have noticed, he is commenting on the Core blog, posting on the Core blog a lot more than he ever used to. My perception is that he feels the need to sort of take control again because he sees a certain vision and he needs to guide the ship in that vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my opinion on that is, well, it&#8217;s his software ultimately. Were it not for him and Mike launching this, and driving this forward, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing this today. So sometimes I need to step back and let the vision play itself out, and see where it goes. And so far it seems to be working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, if you obsess about WordPress quite as much as I do, you would see these little tendrils of professionalism in the way that WordPress is presenting itself. Now, you may like the design of, I don&#8217;t know, the wordpress.org redesign that happened recently, you know, the showcase, and all of those kind of things. You may like them, you may not, but they are kind of opinionated. They seem be very modern. And they are, and I was just using the phrase earlier, enterprise ready, they just speak of, okay, this project isn&#8217;t stale. We are here for your small projects, but we&#8217;re also here for your gigantic projects as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And feels like the impetus on having people like you, boots on ground, paying for you to make this content, it feels that that whole thing is just some sort of bigger vision in the background, which isn&#8217;t necessarily spoken about, but all of the little bits and pieces together mean that, yeah, you can have confidence that there&#8217;s some bigger picture going on. There&#8217;s a direction, there&#8217;s an arrow going in a certain direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, so I&#8217;ve got a final question, and that is that, if I go to learn.wordpress.org, I&#8217;m a lucky person in that my native language is English. So everywhere I go, I see everything written in English, and that makes my life tremendously easy. Now, I know that a lot of people speak English but, how do we educate the people who don&#8217;t?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:56] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. So that is my blessing and my curse. I grew up in a country where English is my first language. I might be living in Africa, but English is my first language. So that means I can easily create and consume that content, but it&#8217;s very difficult for me to translate it. I could translate it to Afrikaans, but that&#8217;s only going to help South Africa, not the rest of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is something that we do need. We do need more folks translating content. Now, we are very fortunate in the training team that we have a number of English second language speakers. One of our team reps, Ben, who you might have met at WordCamp Europe this year, I know he spoke about Learn WordPress. He&#8217;s originally Australian, but grew up in Japan. So Japanese is actually his first language, and English is his second language ironically. And so he&#8217;s very committed towards, internationalising our Learn WordPress content. So we need translators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons why we have the text version of all content on Learn WordPress is so that somebody can translate it. It&#8217;s also the reason we have subtitles, not only for accessibility, but so that someone can translate those subtitles as well. But that only happens with translators, and it&#8217;s not something that I can do. So if you are a translator, if you are somebody who speaks another language and you want to contribute to WordPress, one of the easiest things you can do is take one of the lessons in any one of the courses and help us translate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our Make training team site, in our handbook, we have an onboarding page, and one of the options in that onboarding is, I want to translate content. So we want to try and make it as easy as possible for folks to translate, but we need those folks to come on board. And so getting the word out there is probably one of our biggest tasks, is to get as many translators as we can because one of our goals is to make all this content somehow fully translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve spoken relentlessly for the last 40 minutes in very positive tones about Learn, but obviously there&#8217;s going to be things like that, like translations, also missing content. Content that is on the roadmap, but far away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:44] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> You saw one of them the other day when you were going through the course on your podcast. One of the episodes, one of the lessons had been, what had happened? And I don&#8217;t mind sharing the story because it&#8217;s quite funny. So somebody had translated the lesson and then assigned it to the course, not realising that doing that would&#8217;ve overwritten the original English one. So what you saw was I think a Tamil translation of that lesson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:01] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So, wonderful that the person did the translation, but we hadn&#8217;t quite figured out the process of translating it yet, which is why it came up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That was a funny moment. But the broader question there is, obviously you need more boots on the ground, the project will never be finished, it&#8217;s just not the nature of it. Where do people go if they&#8217;re interested, having listened to this, they&#8217;re interested? I mean, maybe you want to drop a Slack channel, or an email address, or a URL. Whatever you think will serve best for getting people involved with learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:29] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So the best thing that I can suggest is go to make.wordpress.org/training. So that&#8217;ll take you to the training team blog. And then right at the top of that page, just next to the Make WordPress training title, there&#8217;s a link that says Getting Started. Click on that link, scroll down a little bit, and there&#8217;s a video of Ben, who I mentioned earlier, introducing you to the training team. And then there&#8217;s an entire onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through that process. In my opinion, as somebody who&#8217;s been contributing to WordPress for about nine years, we have, as the trading team, one of the best onboarding pages in the teams, because Ben really took the time to sit down and go, right, what do new folks need to know? Where do we need to guide them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He even takes you through your first sort of three contributions and how to do that. And then we also have, tied into that, we have what we call the Training Guide Program, where if you want to, you can get paired up with a training team member to take you through the onboarding process, if you need someone to take you through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to get involved, if you&#8217;re a translator, and I&#8217;m going to start calling for people here now. If you&#8217;re a translator, if you&#8217;re somebody who can do research and script writing. If you&#8217;re somebody who likes to review these videos and give us feedback. If you&#8217;re somebody who&#8217;s a video editor and you can edit from a recorded voice, you can just put images together and create videos, please go to that site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s make.wordpress.org/training, go through the onboarding process and see what role you fit in. And then join us. That onboarding takes you through to where to join in the Slack channel, and who the team is, and what we do, and who the team, it covers everything. But that would be the place that I would recommend you get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting because, usually when there&#8217;s a teacher student relationship, it&#8217;s very much top down. The teacher has all the expertise and is going to disseminate it down. But from what you&#8217;ve said, anybody, whether you be a video editor, an audio editor, whether you&#8217;re just interested in reviewing content, or translating content, there&#8217;s a place. You don&#8217;t have to be that right at the top, educator, down. There&#8217;s a whole jigsaw of different jobs underneath which are needed, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:25] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> And I&#8217;m going to cheat a little bit here, and I&#8217;m also going to say this. And this is my opinion, this is not the opinion of my company, this is not the opinion of the team, but this is my personal opinion. As somebody who has been contributing for the last nine years to multiple different teams, the beauty of Learn WordPress is we are our own little enclosed environment. We have our own code base for learn.wordpress.org. So if you want to commit patches, and bugs, and pull requests, you do it to that code base on its own. You don&#8217;t have to finagle WordPress develop. We&#8217;ve got our own one. And the content is all managed on our own GitHub repository within that, sort of, code base repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re kind of, I always talk about us as this very sort of elite strike force within the WordPress community, focused on learning. And we have all the elements and all the access that we need. We don&#8217;t need to really bother other teams like I&#8217;m sure you know, if you want to fix something on wordpress.org, you have to commit code here, and you have to connect with meta, and you have to log a bug over here. It&#8217;s kind of all over the place. If you want to commit to Core, you&#8217;ve got to find the right Slack channel for the right thing, and the right component, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn is self-contained. So it&#8217;s one of the best places to contribute for the first time, if you&#8217;re a first time contributor, because everything is in one space. We don&#8217;t really have to bother other teams too much. We&#8217;ve got all the tools we need, and we just need more, as you say, boots on the floor to achieve our goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is absolutely perfect. I will make sure that all of the bits and pieces that you mentioned just then get into the show notes. So head over to wptavern.com and search for the episode with Jonathan Bossenger in it. So that&#8217;s all the questions that I&#8217;ve got. Thank you so much for chatting to me today, Jonathan. I&#8217;ve really appreciated it, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:49] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Awesome. No problem. Thank you so much for having me. And I would just like to say, to everybody who was in the, where you highlighted of the developer learning pathway. So it was yourself, Tammie was there, Michelle, and I can&#8217;t remember the other chap&#8217;s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to say what a wonderful experience it was watching something that I&#8217;ve spent the better past of the last year working on, being so well received by folks in the community. One of the comments that was made, I can&#8217;t remember the chap&#8217;s name, but he said something about, he can see that there is a love for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that really just touched me because that is exactly where I come from. There&#8217;s a love to teach others, and it&#8217;s so nice to see that this is appreciated by our community. So I just want to say thank you to you, for highlighting it for everybody who was in that podcast. It was a really, really cool day, and I spent the entire day with this massive smile on my face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, nice. Well, that makes me happy. Thank you so much for chatting to me today, Jonathan. Really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:38] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> No problem. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://jonathanbossenger.com/about/\">Jonathan Bossenger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan, based in Cape Town, South Africa, has been an integral part of the WordPress community for nearly a decade. Transitioning from software development to web and then WordPress development, he found his passion in education. Since attending his first WordCamp in 2015, he has focused on creating educational content for WordPress developers. Now employed at Automattic as a developer educator, he contributes to the Learn platform, helping to train and guide new developers in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s on the podcast today to explain some of the ways that you can learn WordPress with up to date, freely available content. We discuss the goal of making WordPress learning accessible globally, especially for those who can&#8217;t afford expensive courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion gets into the transformative potential of the Learn WordPress platform, especially in the era of Playground, which will enable interactive coding practice without the need for external tools. Jonathan sees this as a game-changer for web agencies, providing a streamlined training resource for new developers and conserving valuable time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover Jonathan&#8217;s journey from software developer to developer educator, supported by his former employer, Castos. He shares the challenges of keeping educational content current amidst WordPress&#8217;s rapid evolution, and the importance of staying updated with WordPress Core developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touches on the structured learning pathways designed to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels, segmented into user, designer, and developer categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The professionalisation of WordPress projects like Learn, and the essential role of contributors in translating and internationalising content to reach a broader audience comes under the microscope as well, and Jonathan reflects upon the dynamic nature of open-source communities, stressing the need for decisive leadership in software development decisions from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we talk about the many ways that you can assist the Learn project, and there are many&nbsp; more ways than you might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how people learn about WordPress, and how you can be a part of that project, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn

is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Birgit:<br />Hi, I am your host, Birgit, and we are here with another episode of <em>The WordPress Way</em>, where we dive deep into the heart and soul of WordPress, exploring the cutting edge and the incredible people shaping its future. I have two lovely guests today on our show, and I would love for them to introduce themselves. I have onboard Megan and Mike. Please, Megan, tell our audience a bit about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Hi. Yeah, so I&#8217;m Megan Rose. I’ve been pretty active in the WordPress community since around 2014, so people might know me from there. I’m based in northeast Ohio, and I work with the WordPress community here, as well as on the WordCamp US organizing team and the Incident Response Team. Alternatively, people might know me from Codeable, where I’m the Head of Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s impressive. To explain to the audience, you and I met previously at several WordCamps, and it’s really good to see that someone like you is also part of the Incident Response Team, which plays a crucial role in improving DEIB. Mike, would you mind telling the audience a bit about yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sure. I also work at Codeable alongside Megan, and we’re on the same team. That’s how I ended up here—we’re recently coworkers, and she just asked if I’d be willing to come on. Let’s see, my background is not in WordPress. The majority of my background—and my degree, in fact—is in social work, but I also have a few years of experience in sales and other customer-facing roles. In my, I guess, “free time”—or rather, not-work-related time—I’ve also been a volunteer. It’s called a Harassment and Grievance Officer, doing similar code of conduct work for a local community organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Wow, really impressive. It’s interesting to learn more about coworkers while recording a podcast. As Mike said, I also recently joined Codeable within the support team, but nevertheless, I invited you both because we share a common passion for improving diversity and fostering inclusion. Mike, you mentioned the code of conduct work—how do you approach that best? For me, English is not my first language, so sometimes it’s difficult to articulate myself clearly. Please bear with me. I’ve prepared some questions and would love to hear from you, Megan. Can you share your experience with community management and the strategies you’ve found effective in fostering an inclusive environment? You mentioned you’re on the Incident Response Team within the global WordPress community. Could you share some of your experiences and what you encounter daily?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Yeah, sure. I’ll start by saying my experiences are my own and not necessarily shared by others at Codeable, but when I first got involved in the WordPress community, it felt a little like a boys’ club. There were times when community members would say things that made me uncomfortable, and I even had someone slide into my DMs at one point. So, I knew I had some work ahead of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I already had experience handling code of conduct issues and felt confident tackling these kinds of challenges—and with the support of management—I dove right into laying the groundwork for a more welcoming environment, especially for women and gender minorities. One of the first things I did was introduce a code of conduct process. I actually borrowed heavily from the WordPress community&#8217;s code of conduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress, there are two codes of conduct: one is event-specific, used at WordCamps, and the other is the overarching one that was introduced, I believe, in 2020, when things moved online due to the pandemic. The shift to online spaces made it clear we needed a more comprehensive approach. I adapted that structure and began reporting at the end of the year on how many incidents were dealt with, anonymizing the data for privacy. I think that helped build trust, especially within gender minority and LGBTQ+ groups, who had previously experienced discomfort in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also made adjustments to our termination procedures, requiring a staff vote, and moved towards more education-focused responses rather than purely punitive measures. I’m proud of my ability to have one-on-one conversations with people who may have said or done something that made someone else feel unwelcome. Often, these are long conversations, but they help change minds and foster better understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s really interesting. You mentioned the global WordPress community, but you also work with Codeable, fostering its expert community, which exists within the broader WordPress ecosystem. Given the male-dominated nature of this field and the cultural diversity, how do you navigate conversations about inclusive language and respect? For example, when I attended the CloudFest Hackathon, I worked on improving the check for inclusive language within WordPress. Though the project didn’t turn out as I envisioned, I learned a lot about cultural perspectives. How do you raise awareness when issues occur, especially when different people might have different boundaries or triggers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Yeah, I think goal number one when I first started was to earn the community’s trust and respect. That’s not something that happens overnight. Everyone’s worked somewhere where a new person comes in and starts making big changes, and it can feel off-putting. So, I didn’t want to be that person. I spent a lot of time just having casual, one-on-one conversations, getting to know people, and building trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have experienced negative things in the past and reported them with no real outcome, there’s a silencing effect. They’re less likely to report things again in the future. I made it a priority to show that there was a process in place and that it would be followed fairly. In some cases, people reported incidents to me directly, expressing fear that following the formal process might negatively impact the income of the person they were reporting. It’s a complicated situation when you’re afraid of affecting someone’s livelihood. This can make it harder for people to come forward, and I think that hesitation exists within the WordPress space as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yes, thank you for sharing that insight. As you mentioned, some people may be hesitant to report incidents because they feel their concerns aren&#8217;t serious enough, or they fear consequences. But everyone has different boundaries, and we need to have systems that allow people to express discomfort or request mediation. One of the things I love about the WordPress community is that, overall, we care for each other. Mike, as someone newer to the WordPress community, but with a background in social work, could you share your observations about the WordPress ecosystem, especially compared to your previous experiences?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sure. Like I said, most of my background is in social work, which definitely helps in customer service roles. My direct experience with WordPress or open-source communities has been limited, but as a teenager, I was really into Mozilla and the launch of Firefox. I’ve always been more interested in the philosophical side of open source rather than the software development side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an outside perspective, I try to bring a sense of non-judgmental acceptance, something I learned from social work. This helps when dealing with code of conduct situations where people make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean they’re bad people. Mistakes happen. I try to approach these situations with empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk about diversity in open source, especially WordPress, I think there’s a bit of a contradiction. WordPress exists within capitalism, and as long as a handful of companies control WordPress, we can’t fully democratize publishing the way we might hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />You bring up a really interesting point. There’s always that tension between the community-driven aspect of WordPress and the capitalist environment it operates within. I remember discussions about creating a governance board for WordPress—there’s still some optimism around that. From your perspective, how can we reconcile these contradictions and push for more transparency and fairness, especially when it comes to pay equity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, we’ve talked about this before. I believe transparency is crucial, especially when it comes to pay. It’s easy for companies to say they care about diversity, but it means nothing if there’s a significant pay disparity that goes unaddressed. Gender-based pay disparities, for example, are still very common, and they’re not something that should be shrugged off as someone else’s problem. It’s our problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a company like Buffer, for example. They’ve publicly listed every employee’s name and salary on their website. That kind of transparency is how you show you’re serious about fairness. In the U.S., it’s illegal for companies to prevent employees from discussing their salaries, but people are still discouraged from doing so. If you really care about diversity and inclusion, that transparency has to be there, and it starts with talking to your coworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s a powerful point, and it connects to the broader conversation about company culture. It’s not just about what you do as an individual but about creating systemic changes. Megan, you mentioned some great strategies earlier about de-escalation and setting boundaries. Would you mind expanding on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Sure. De-escalation is one of my favorite things—it feels like an art form to me. I try to blend it seamlessly into conversations, often using humor to diffuse tension. If things get heated, especially during a video call, I might make a joke like, “Well, we all know politicians always have our best interests at heart, right?” It’s a light way of finding common ground, without getting preachy. Humor works in face-to-face or video interactions but might not be appropriate in something like Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When humor doesn’t work, I’m comfortable with a hard pivot. If someone’s talking about something I don’t want to engage with, I might just say, “Okay, let’s move on.” You can also ask people about their personal interests—like how their kids are doing in school. It helps shift the conversation without creating conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s such a useful approach, and it really resonates with me. And speaking of personal milestones, I have to mention—today was my grandson’s first day of school. He’s six years old, and I’m so proud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, to wrap things up, could you share some tips on improving written communication, especially in support roles, where you often only have text to work with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Absolutely. One of the biggest things I’ve noticed is that people often aren’t clear in their communication because they assume others understand the context. This can be especially true with native speakers, who might use casual language or euphemisms that aren’t clear to everyone. My advice is to always draft your message, then reread it from the perspective of someone who doesn’t know what you’re thinking. Precision is key—being direct and clear avoids misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tip is to focus on being non-judgmental, especially when addressing mistakes. We all make errors, but that doesn’t define us as people. It’s important to approach situations with empathy and understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Thank you both for sharing your insights and personal stories. It’s been a truly enlightening conversation. I hope everyone listening takes a moment to reflect on what we’ve discussed—pat yourselves on the back for the work you’re doing, but also remember to take care of your own mental health. Megan, Mike, I’m so grateful for your time today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to our listeners, thank you for tuning in to <em>The WordPress Way</em>.

This requires time, one-on-one conversations, and an understanding of the existing dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Implementation</strong>: Introducing a clear and transparent code of conduct can foster a safer and more welcoming environment. Megan emphasized the importance of having processes in place for handling incidents, reporting them anonymously, and ensuring follow-through to build confidence in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>De-escalation and Conflict Resolution</strong>: Megan shared practical techniques for de-escalating tense conversations, particularly in a global and diverse community. Humor, setting boundaries, and using a &#8220;hard pivot&#8221; to shift topics can be effective strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Transparency and Fairness in Pay</strong>: Mike highlighted the need for transparency in compensation, arguing that real diversity and inclusion efforts are incomplete without addressing pay disparities. They/them advocates for open discussions about pay and collective action to address inequalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Written Communication in Customer Support</strong>: In support roles, written communication is key. Mike suggested drafting and rereading responses from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the situation to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigating Global Cultural Differences</strong>: In a globally distributed community like WordPress, cultural differences must be acknowledged and respected. Community leaders should foster inclusive environments that take into account diverse perspectives and backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Promoting Inclusivity in Male-Dominated Fields</strong>: The WordPress and tech industries can sometimes feel male-dominated, but intentional efforts, like those from Megan, to create welcoming spaces for women and gender minorities can make a significant impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Democratizing Governance and Decision-Making</strong>: The conversation touched on the broader topic of democratizing the structures within the WordPress ecosystem and the companies that support it, including calls for more employee representation and shared decision-making in companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/megabyterose/\">Megan on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.codeable.io/story/\">Codeable</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/\">WordPress Community Code of Conduct</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/incident-response-team-training/\">WordPress Incident Response Team training</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 11:39:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.7 Roadmap Includes New Default Theme, APIs, and Media Enhancements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161079\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-7-roadmap-includes-new-default-theme-apis-and-media-enhancements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3517:\"<p>Anne McCarthy has unveiled the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/09/03/roadmap-to-6-7/\">roadmap for WordPress 6.7</a>, slated for release on November 12, 2024. This will be the final major update of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has emphasized that “More than anything though, this release brings refinement to how everything connects together to create a more seamless WordPress experience, whether you’re trying to upload a HEIC image to your site or display a selection of posts with the Query Loop block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.7 will ship with a new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/introducing-twenty-twenty-five/\">Twenty Twenty-Five</a>, that “embodies ultimate flexibility and adaptability”. Fully compatible with the Site Editor, the theme features high-quality fonts supporting multiple languages, a variety of color palettes, and an extensive collection of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release will also include two new APIs designed to simplify developers&#8217; workflows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-19-1-introduces-plugin-template-registration-api\">Template Registration API</a> to allow templates and template parts to be registered directly within plugins without filters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preview Options API to expand the Preview dropdown menu in the post/page editor and add greater flexibility in preview functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Several existing APIs, such as the Interactivity API, Block Bindings API, and HTML API, will also see enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New features offering more flexibility and functionality will improve the data view experience. Users can expect options to hide or show filters in the interface, adjust the density of information in the grid layout, and configure the grid layout&#8217;s aspect ratio to their preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop block will be updated to ease customization. Improvements include refining settings copy and context detection for a more intuitive user experience. For a better editing experience, WordPress 6.7 will introduce an option to zoom out and work at the pattern level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant updates to media handling are also on the way, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/automatic-conversion-of-heic-images-to-jpeg-in-wordpress-6-7/\">HEIC support</a>, auto sizes for lazy loaded images, and more background image support at individual and global levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other highlights of WordPress 6.7 include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Updates to design tools, including shadow support for Group blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved support for PHP 8.x and removing code specific for unsupported versions.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new split view for the iframe post editor to ensure a consistent WYSIWYG experience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removing the experimental status of typography blocks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new feature in the Styles interface allowing users to customize theme presets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne has cautioned that the new features mentioned in the post “ is being actively pursued, but doesn’t necessarily mean each will make it into the final release of WordPress 6.7.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested users can look into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/16/hallway-hangout-recording-lets-chat-about-whats-next-in-gutenberg-august-2024/\">demos</a> shared during a recent hallway hangout to get a glimpse into what&#8217;s being developed for this release and future updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:03:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 14.1.0 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=335040\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://buddypress.org/2024/09/buddypress-14-1-0-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1038:\"<p>Immediately available is <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.14.1.0.zip\">BuddyPress 14.1.0</a>.

Welcome to yet another session of the notorious, not-so-notorious-yet accessibility podcast at Do the Woo. With me today is Maestro Stevens from Iconic Templates. Now, some of you may know him, while to some of you, he may come as a total surprise. But I promise you, this is going to be a very entertaining conversation about scalability, accessibility, being part of the WordPress community—especially in that regard—and, of course, e-commerce and accessibility. But as usual, we are trying to get guests on the show who are in the midst of learning about or working with accessibility, instead of always featuring people who already know everything. There are so many people who don’t know yet, and we’re going to get the other specialists on for sure at some point. The goal is that we all learn how to implement accessibility in e-commerce because it&#8217;s incredibly important. We are all learning, we are all struggling, and we are all going to get there at some point. Also with us today is Bob Dunn, and today Bob is representing Taeka, who, due to circumstances, couldn’t be with us today. He is here to protect all of you from me and Maestro talking too much about unrelated things, because we like to babble, right, Bob?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Right? Yeah, yeah. I’ll be the podcast bouncer, and that’s it. I’m always accessible to do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, that’s wonderful. So, for people who don’t know me, a little bit of my background: I’m an accessibility specialist and a big mouth in the WordPress community. I love to connect people, I love to learn, I love to teach, and I hope I can bring you some extras every time we do this. And Maestro, I would say let’s go. Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and what you’re doing in daily life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, yes. Thank you, Anne, and thank you, Bob, as well for having me on. I’ve been greatly anticipating this opportunity. But just a little bit about me—as Anne already said, my name is Maestro Stevens, and I am the owner and founder of Iconic Templates. We are a template-based platform for WordPress. It mainly came from me being an advocate and a user of other people’s templates for years, starting my journey, I would say, back in 2008. So, I’m no WordPress &#8220;old-schooler&#8221; as I call it, like the people who came in way before me. But I definitely love the fact that WordPress has given me opportunities, flexibility, and new lessons as far as community and developing websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Alright, so what is your accessibility angle, just to put you on the spot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />When it comes to e-commerce and accessibility, I would say I am a newbie on the cusp of becoming an intermediate person. For me, accessibility is still an ocean of wonders and questions. I’m not a technical person in terms of development, and what I’ve learned about accessibility has a lot to do with development practices and design practices as well. I’m neither a designer nor a developer, so my experience is more relatable to the average person. But what I’ve learned is the importance and necessity of accessibility, because there are many more people in the world who I assumed could access websites, but they can’t because of various disabilities or disadvantages. So, I’m learning. I’m a work in progress, but I’ve learned a lot so far. In the e-commerce world, especially, it’s critical—because people can’t buy what they can’t see. If they can’t access your website or experience it in certain ways, how can you expect them to purchase your product?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And it’s not just about seeing, right? It’s always interesting that accessibility is thought of as something for people who are blind, but the group of people affected is so much larger. You’re missing out on a ton of conversions if your website is filled with sliders and moving elements. Accessibility as an important part of your conversion strategy is something people tend to forget. And I know you like to look at things from a larger perspective. I find it interesting that you don’t have a development background, because that’s important for everyone to know, especially when creating websites. I mean, WordPress enables us to install WooCommerce and create a webshop without knowing what we’re doing. In a sense, it guides us, which is wonderful. But if you’re working at a professional level, you have to understand—just like with bookkeeping—you don’t have to know how to do your own bookkeeping, but you need to be able to read the numbers. So, I’m challenging you here. This is what we call &#8220;shooting at an open goal.&#8221; Now, if there are conversion advantages to accessibility, especially in e-commerce, what advantages do you see? Can you expand on that? And I have the same question for Bob, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yeah, I’ll start with this: The reason I didn’t mention conversions is that I always try to speak to a C-level grade student audience. I consider myself a C-level student. And when I start using big words, people start asking more questions, and they get confused. So, I like to come up with little metaphors, similes, or simple ways to explain things that the average person can understand. Then I give them the &#8220;juice,&#8221; as we say. So yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It is about conversions. For example, if you have a button on your website that’s a certain color or it’s developed in a way that makes it jittery or weird, it can make it hard for someone to commit to moving forward to the next step, whether that’s a sale, a subscription, or joining your email list. So, in my opinion, that’s one example of how accessibility can affect conversions—using buttons. As far as I know, links and buttons are what move us forward to the next step on the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Links and buttons—those are an interesting topic. I’ll keep a mental note to get back to that. Bob, what about you? What does accessibility in e-commerce mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well, I agree a lot with what Maestro said. It’s interesting because I think about accessibility and wonder where we draw the line. I’ll give you an example. Today I was on a site ordering something. When I got to the checkout and entered my address, it gave me two lines—one for the first part of the address and one for the second part. Our address is quite long, and when I hit &#8220;next step,&#8221; it moved the second part of the address onto the first line, saying, “Your address is limited to 34 characters.” So, I had to think, “How can I adjust this to make it deliverable?” And while that might be more of a technical issue with the checkout form, it made me think about accessibility—this was frustrating to me, and I can see and think through the problem. But what kind of issues would this pose for others? It’s strange—these little things can create big problems. For instance, I get vertigo sometimes, and scrolling can be tough for me. But if something comes on the screen with wiggly or strange movements because someone is trying to be clever, it becomes challenging. So, yeah, it’s a constant challenge for far more people than we might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, this is so true. Unfortunately, these issues are hard to measure when talking to companies. Whether it’s in the U.S., where they need to be compliant, or here in Europe, where the European Accessibility Act is going to hit like a tsunami, it’s important to understand. You are naming examples here, and they’re hard to measure. Companies complain that they pay SEO specialists thousands every month, and they celebrate when their click rate increases by half a percent. But at some point, they’ll notice that conversions are failing or bounce rates are high. You can spend all the money you want on SEO, but you’ll still have unexplained bounces if your website isn&#8217;t accessible. You can’t measure assistive technology usage—that would be an incredible breach of privacy. This is always a tough discussion between shop owners and companies that need to make their shops accessible. They want numbers, but common sense should also play a role. If you&#8217;re working on a webshop, whether you&#8217;re a developer or not, you need to understand basic things—like buttons and links. Few people outside of coding know that a button does something and a link goes somewhere. People like to wrap links in buttons that look like buttons. In hardcore accessibility circles, people will say, “Don’t do that,” but we’re talking about inclusion here, and everyone should be included, not just people who rely on assistive technology. We are all sensitive to certain stimuli, and we can all benefit from accessibility features. Have you ever tried turning your screen to black and white on your iPhone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! To your point, I’ve noticed a trend where people are becoming more conscious of these things. In email templates, for instance, you can’t control the email client—whether it’s Gmail or Yahoo (does anyone still use Yahoo? I’m sure someone does!). And it’s interesting that with Apple’s iOS updates, they&#8217;re allowing users to change the gradients on icons. But when it comes to color changes, I’ve noticed that people who are accessibility-conscious will often change the default link color from blue to something more legible in dark mode, for example. Chrome, Safari, and other browsers all handle accessibility in their own ways, but they don’t always follow the same rulebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Doesn’t that scare you a little?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! It’s both fascinating and scary. There are certain things you just can’t control. But what can you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And going back to Bob’s example about the form—this is where UI and UX go hand in hand. People say you can’t make beautiful accessible websites, which is nonsense. But something practical like a form—I love it when a form is coded so it asks, “Do you want to autofill this?” That’s not just helpful for jittery users—it’s helpful for everyone. Accessibility is primarily intended for people who use assistive technology, but then it helps everyone else too. And it’s interesting to see how page builders and themes handle this. Some of them are like, “Hey, look at this beautiful form widget,” but wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you didn’t have to worry whether the browser will offer autofill options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, and I’ve seen this a lot, especially with email templates. Different email clients handle accessibility differently, and it’s the same with browsers. But going back to your point—there are so many things we can’t control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, it’s like when you’re working with page builders or themes, and they offer these forms that look great, but are they accessible? You need to test that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Exactly. And this goes back to how accessibility affects conversions. If people can’t use your forms, how can they complete their purchase? It’s all connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Absolutely. So, we’ve covered a lot of ground here. Do you have any final thoughts, Maestro, before we wrap up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Just that accessibility is a journey. I’m still learning, and I hope to continue improving. It’s important for everyone to start somewhere, and we can all make a difference by making our websites more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you so much for joining us today, Maestro. It was a pleasure having you on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of the <strong>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>, hosts <strong>Anne</strong> and BobWP are joined by <strong>Maestro Stevens</strong>, founder of <strong>Iconic Templates</strong>, as he shares his journey of learning accessibility for the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, they dive into the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for making online stores more accessible, not just for compliance but to improve conversions and user experience for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re new to accessibility or looking for ways to integrate it into your WordPress projects, this conversation offers valuable insights, practical tips, and reflections from professionals in the process of learning and implementing accessible web practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility is for Everyone</strong>: Accessibility isn’t just about making websites usable for people with visual impairments—it benefits everyone, including those with cognitive, physical, and situational challenges. Making a site accessible improves the overall user experience and helps more people engage with your content or products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility and Conversions</strong>: A key point in the discussion was that accessibility directly impacts conversions, especially in e-commerce. If users can&#8217;t navigate your site or interact with elements like buttons or forms, they can’t complete transactions. Accessible design helps remove barriers, ensuring that all users can take the desired actions, such as making purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing Awareness in WordPress</strong>: Both Maestro and Anne discussed the growing importance of accessibility in the WordPress and WooCommerce communities. WordPress is actively developing more accessible features, and WooCommerce is improving accessibility in product creation and checkout experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning is a Journey</strong>: <strong>Maestro</strong> shared that he’s still learning about accessibility and how to incorporate it into his projects. This is an important reminder that it’s okay to start small and grow your knowledge over time. Tools like the <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> plugin can help identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication are Key</strong>: When making websites more accessible, collaboration between developers, designers, and clients is essential. Clear communication about the importance of accessibility can help shift mindsets and lead to better results. Approaching accessibility with respect and consideration encourages progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Assistive Technology</strong>: Assistive technology is critical for people with disabilities, but there’s no easy way to measure how many people use it on your website. As Anne pointed out, some things like form autofill or visual simplicity can help many users, even those who don’t rely on assistive tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: As the conversation highlighted, accessibility is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly updating your website with accessibility in mind ensures that it remains usable for all visitors, including those with different abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://iconictemplates.com\">Iconic Templates</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maestrostevens/\">Maestro on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker\">Accessibility Checker by Equalize Digital</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 14:22:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Akismet: Demand Generation vs Lead Generation — Use Both to Grow Customers and Revenue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://akismet.com/blog/demand-generation-vs-lead-generation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18475:\"<p>To make a customer, you first have to <em>attract</em> potential customers. But if all you ever do is <em>attract</em> them, and not engage and sell to them, your company won’t grow fast enough. This is why, when you hear about demand generation vs lead generation, your reaction should be that you need both, not one or the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n\n<p>Neglect either one of these, and your revenue will eventually feel the effects. You’ll either shrink your pool of qualified leads and potential customers, or you’ll fail to convert as many as you should have the ones you have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, both lead generation and demand generation play huge roles in business growth. You need to commit to and succeed in both if you want to see sustained revenue increases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at each&nbsp;concept.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284132\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is demand&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation focuses on attracting new potential customers. In funnel speak, the focus here is on top-of-funnel marketing. You’re creating interest and curiosity about your products and services. You’re making people lean in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>When we talk about how marketing is about getting attention amid the intense competition and chaos of the digital world, we’re talking about demand generation. Getting noticed. Being memorable. Becoming part of the conversation in people’s&nbsp;minds.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Did you hear about….” is a demand generation question asked by someone who was successfully marketed to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to gain attention, interest, or curiosity. You’ll ask people to do things like click, read, open, watch, and comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal is to position a product, service, or brand as something positive, helpful, useful, or trustworthy in your particular industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Informative</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memorable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Educational&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easily-accessible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll use tactics such as social media marketing, influencer marketing, email campaigns that aren’t directly selling, giveaways, webinars, and free content. Larger companies might also use legacy media channels like TV and radio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-demand-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of demand generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n<p>Not every potential customer is ready to buy right now. But if you’ve done effective demand generation marketing, when the time comes for them to buy, your company or product will be at the top of their&nbsp;mind.</p>\n\n\n<p>At the top of the sales funnel, people are just shopping around. They’re not ready to make decisions. They’re not ready to fill out forms, sign up for consultations, or give you their contact information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing engages people who aren’t even looking, and those who are looking but aren’t necessarily that serious about it yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a customer may be happy with their current car insurance. But they know they’re planning to buy a new car in the next couple of years, and when they do, they might take a fresh look at their insurance. Demand generation marketing gives them a direction to go when that time comes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing, broadly speaking, gets measured with broad metrics. You’re focusing here on reach more than&nbsp;engagement.</p>\n\n\n<p>That means things like visibility, social mentions and shares, opens, click-through rates, and webpage traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is lead&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>While demand generation is about creating desire, spurring positive feelings, and being remembered, lead generation is about inspiring action. With demand generation, no one has to commit to anything. With lead generation, someone is going to call you or fill out a form — and you’re expecting them to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we’ve moved down the funnel a bit. Desire has grown, and the motivation to act, engage, and possibly buy has taken over. Now, the lead is thinking, “I need this, or I want this, and maybe this is the direction to go.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got their attention. Now, you’re converting that attention into something you hope results in a sale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to collect customer data, initiate follow-up, nurture a relationship, actively engage with prospects, or make an offer and complete a sale. You’ll be asking potential customers to do things like sign up, join, request, try a sample, start a free trial, or make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation always comes with some sort of offer, and usually that’s in exchange for their contact information. This is the goal — to obtain their information so you can follow up and pursue the relationship and an eventual&nbsp;sale.</p>\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Direct</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specific</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Empowering</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution-oriented</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer-driven</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Urgent</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Media for lead generation marketing can overlap quite a bit with demand generation media, but it’s more in how you use it. You can use social media, but the call to action will be more specific than “learn&nbsp;more.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation tends to be much more effective when done with the help of marketing automation. With automation, you can develop follow-up processes and sequences that you can track for people at all sorts of stages in their customer journeys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead&#8209;gen marketing uses assets like landing pages, paid ads, live chat, and lead magnet tools like white papers, eBooks, free trials, and time&#8209;limited coupons and discounts for new&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Minimize friction at conversion points by reducing the number of fields that prospects must fill out. The quickest way to boost your results is to eliminate CAPTCHAs and other anti-spam checks. Instead, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">use Akismet</a> to block 99.99% of spam without interrupting the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-lead-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of lead generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>With lead generation, you’re requiring a decision that carries some sort of consequence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prospect thinks, “Either I engage with this, and then I can expect certain things to follow, or I can choose not to engage.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation presumes a pre-existing level of interest. If someone complains about being “sold” by your marketing, in the negative sense, that simply means this person hasn’t yet experienced enough of your demand marketing. You’re pushing them too far, too early. They aren’t ready to give you their contact information. They feel “pressured.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a potential customer who knows what they need, knows what they’re looking for, and wants to find a good solution won’t respond to lead generation marketing like that at all. They want it. They want helpful content, answers, customer service, and the opportunity to move forward with someone they believe can help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured by the sorts of metrics you can more directly link to revenue. This includes things like signups, responses, quote forms filled out, demos requested, free trials started, and conversions. Other lead generation metrics include cost per lead and lead response time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these metrics lead to money. More signups mean more sales. Lower lead response time means more leads engaged more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"key-differences-between-demand-and-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key differences between demand and lead&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>As you’ve probably picked up already, while some overlap exists between demand generation and lead generation, these are very different types of marketing. Let’s explore the differences in more&nbsp;detail.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-focus-and purpose\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core focus and&nbsp;purpose</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing focuses on building an audience. When this type of marketing has worked, if you speak, people listen. If you make an announcement, people pay attention. You have their trust, or at least their awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing works at converting the audience you’ve already built through demand generation. If you have 100,000 people who have expressed or felt some level of interest, how many of those can you motivate to give their contact information or request your lead magnet offer? That’s the question lead generation marketing is&nbsp;answering.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png\" alt=\"WPVIP lead capture form\" class=\"wp-image-284134\" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"timing-and-stage-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timing and stage in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>The timing of both of these types of marketing can vary dramatically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this can all happen in a single session with a new lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a person already knows they need something you sell, but they haven’t acted on it yet. This person could be called a “warm unknown prospect.” Maybe they’re the type of person who makes fast decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This person sees a post on social media. Their interest is piqued because they’ve already been thinking about something they need related to the content of the post. So, they engage with the post by clicking on it, which takes them to an article on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>From there, they explore your site, look at your products, and then come across a lead magnet offer for a 30&#8209;day coupon for new customers. They sign up. Now, the clock is ticking. In less than 30 days, this person could travel through all stages of the buying journey and make a purchase, becoming a&nbsp;customer.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it could go even faster than that. They could make a purchase the same&nbsp;day.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, the same process could be drawn out over months, even years, for another potential customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some industries have shorter sales cycles, and others have longer ones. Sometimes, you continue to nurture and develop the relationship merely to sustain interest. During that time, you also continue to make lead generation offers. Some in your audience will act on those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"strategies-and tactics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategies and&nbsp;tactics</h3>\n\n<p>Strategies for demand generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Attention&#8209;getting language or multimedia&nbsp;imagery</li>\n\n\n<li>Humor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building content</li>\n\n\n<li>Low&#8209;stakes offers like reading reviews and consuming free&nbsp;content</li>\n\n<li>Consistent content and media&nbsp;presence</li>\n\n<li>Low or no&#8209;pressure&nbsp;content</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Strategies for lead generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Targeted and measurable offers — including free&nbsp;ones</li>\n\n<li>Lead magnets that collect contact&nbsp;information</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow-up emails</li>\n\n\n<li>Demonstrations, consultations, free&nbsp;trials</li>\n\n<li>New customer discounts, promotions, and&nbsp;giveaways</li>\n\n<li>CTAs that demand a&nbsp;decision</li></ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"measurement-and metrics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measurement and&nbsp;metrics</h3>\n\n<p>When demand generation works, your audience grows with people who are open to becoming a lead. You’re not reaching out directly to them yet, but if you did, they’d be more likely to be&nbsp;responsive.</p>\n\n\n<p>When lead generation works, your engaged audience is ready to consider becoming a customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You measure the metrics that support each of these outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation gets measured with visibility, likes, opens, shares, web traffic, views, and seconds or minutes watched, for something like a webinar or a YouTube ad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured with form submissions, demos and consultations scheduled and attended, redeemed coupons, converted free trials, as well as the process-metrics like cost per lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-need-both-lead-and-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why you need both lead and demand&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>You need both because each type of marketing fills missing gaps in the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n<p>If all you do is demand generation, you’ll build an audience, but you won’t convert nearly as many of them into paying customers as you should have. If all you do is lead generation, you’ll have too small a pool to draw from, and will be constantly trying to attract new leads from people who’ve never heard of&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n\n<p>Generating leads from total strangers takes a lot more work and money than generating leads from people who are at least familiar with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analogy would be like trying to irrigate a field with water from a trickling stream, rather than an abundant river.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation provides the river. Lead generation waters the field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"faqs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQs</h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-lead-generation-work-without-prior-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can lead generation work without prior demand&nbsp;generation?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Yes, but it requires a lot more effort, and will usually produce a lot less revenue. With sufficiently targeted marketing, you can create leads from a cold audience. But that target audience, which has to be pre-existing, needs to already be large enough to generate enough quality leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-common-challenges-in-lead-generation-and-how-can-i-overcome them\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common challenges in lead generation, and how can I overcome&nbsp;them?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Common challenges include not knowing where to look, not having sufficient follow-up marketing, and being timid in making or closing the sale — letting good leads languish on the vine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for knowing where to look, with demand generation marketing, you can build your own audience and then find leads from there. Other than that, look for pre-existing media where your audience already congregates, such as an industry event. Or, use targeted online advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the follow-up problem, you want to create the plan before launching the lead gen campaign. Otherwise, you get a bunch of leads, but you miss the opportunity to convert them. Create a plan and a process for how you will contact your leads. Have a phone script. Have an email welcome series. Send them something in the mail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1.png\" alt=\"Email from Dan-O\" class=\"wp-image-284135\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To inspire confidence in prospects to take action, you must first have confidence in your own ability to sell and the essential role your product or service will play in their lives. For larger companies, it takes a highly-trained sales team and a process that works, and that adapts to the needs of the moment for each prospect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-akismet-help-in-improving-the-quality-of-my-lead-generation efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can Akismet help in improving the quality of my lead generation&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n<p>A big part of lead generation is online form submissions. And this is where you run into the annoying problem of bots and scammers filling out your <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/lead-generation-forms/\">lead generation forms</a>. To prevent this, many companies turn to CAPTCHA and other visual puzzles to verify people are humans. But this just passes on the annoyance to your leads. Making them solve puzzles doesn’t set them up to be converted into&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet helps improve lead generation</a> by securing your forms from scammers without forcing your leads to slog through silly puzzles they can’t read and can barely see just to get a hold of your lead magnet or sign up for your free demo or consultation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No puzzles. No roadblocks. And, no spammers. Your forms just work, and it all happens in the background so no one even knows it’s a thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Over 100 million websites currently use Akismet, including<a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\"> enterprise clients</a> such as Microsoft, Bluehost, and ConvertKit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">Here’s more about ConvertKit’s experience</a> with&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about-integrating-akismet-with-my-marketing efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about integrating Akismet with my marketing&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Find out more</a> about how Akismet works in the background to create a zero-friction web form experience for your leads.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress Training Team Seeks Ideas to Attract New Learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160887\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-ideas-to-attract-new-learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1991:\"<p>The WordPress Training Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">currently seeking ideas and feedback</a> from the community to prioritize activities that will increase engagement with the newly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/02/meet-the-new-learn-wordpress/\">revamped Learn WordPress platform</a> and attract new learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Kathryn Presner stated, “We want to have a steady flow of new learners discovering the site and taking advantage of the valuable resources it offers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has outlined three types of potential activities that the Training Team is considering &#8211;  expanding marketing initiatives, increasing the Training Team’s visibility at WordCamps, and equipping learners and contributors with resources to promote Learn WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community members can go through the list of planned promotional activities, workshops, and events in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">Kathryn’s post</a>.

These systems play a critical role in ensuring the security and compliance of IT environments by managing and securing user identities, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining operational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, implementing and managing digital identity systems is no easy feat. Poor digital identity management can expose organizations to a wide range of risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations. These risks can have severe consequences, ranging from financial losses to reputational damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help IT professionals navigate this complex landscape, we&#8217;ve put together a comprehensive guide on digital identity systems. We’ll explain the definition and importance of digital identity systems, along with their key components and benefits. We&#8217;ll also compare leading platforms like Gravatar, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, and OneLogin, examining their features and integration capabilities. Additionally, we&#8217;ll discuss regulatory challenges and technological advancements shaping the future of digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a digital identity platform?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A digital identity platform is a system designed to manage and <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">verify digital identities</a> within an organization. It plays a vital role in ensuring that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times, which maintains security and operational efficiency. These platforms help authenticate users, manage their access permissions, and track their activities to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital identity systems are essential in modern IT environments due to the growing need for strict security measures and efficient identity management. With the rise of online security threats and the increasing complexity of regulatory requirements, these systems help organizations stay compliant and secure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While digital identity systems are designed to mitigate risks, they can potentially introduce new challenges if not implemented and managed properly. Improper configuration, weak security measures, or lack of regular updates can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit. However, these risks are not inherent to the systems themselves but rather stem from how they are deployed and maintained within an organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how to effectively implement and manage digital identity systems while minimizing potential risks, it&#8217;s essential to start with a strong foundation. This includes understanding the structure of digital identity systems, their key components, and how they interact with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin by exploring these fundamental aspects of digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key components of an effective digital identity system&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Identity verification</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">Identity verification</a> is at the core of any digital identity system. It ensures users are who they claim to be and keeps data safe against unauthorized access. Common methods include Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. For instance, after entering a password, users might also need to enter a code sent to their phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another method is the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/09/single-sign-on-solutions/\">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>, which simplifies the login process by allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. When you combine that with a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/26/revamping-user-authentication-the-role-of-passkeys/\">powerful passkey integration</a>, it significantly reduces password fatigue and improves security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes, which are often used in financial services to verify identities through documentation and background checks, ensuring compliance with regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, role-based access control assigns permissions based on the different roles or job positions within an organization. This means employees have access only to the information and systems necessary for their jobs. For example, a marketing manager might have access to the company’s social media accounts but not the financial records.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strategy like this comes with many benefits:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access by restricting users to predefined roles.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Makes it easier to manage permissions and enforce security policies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improves operational efficiency by streamlining access management.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensures that new employees quickly gain the necessary access without compromising security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removes information clutter allowing users to access only the information they need.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lifecycle management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifecycle management involves overseeing user identities from onboarding to offboarding. This includes creating accounts, assigning roles, configuring permissions, and eventually deactivating accounts when people leave the organization. Effective lifecycle management ensures that user profiles are always up-to-date and secure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, when employees change departments, their access permissions should be adjusted accordingly. This process prevents security gaps arising from outdated or incorrect access rights, reducing the risk of insider threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Auditing and compliance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Auditing and compliance are crucial for monitoring user activities, tracking resource access, and ensuring adherence to security policies and regulations.

Whether you&#8217;re an IT professional, a developer, or a tech enthusiast, join us in discovering how FIDO passkeys are shaping the future of secure online authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is FIDO? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed by the <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FIDO Alliance</a>, Fast Identity Online (FIDO) represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at redefining online security. It’s a set of security specifications that significantly reduce our reliance on passwords, introducing a more secure and <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/26/revamping-user-authentication-the-role-of-passkeys/\">user-friendly method of authentication</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of FIDO&#8217;s approach is the concept of local authentication. Instead of sending your password across the internet where it could be intercepted, FIDO performs the authentication on your device. This method is much more secure and enhances privacy by ensuring your unique credentials never leave your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging cryptographic keys, FIDO allows users to prove their identity online without revealing sensitive information. This innovative approach makes it much harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts, as they can&#8217;t simply steal a password. Instead, they would need physical access to the user&#8217;s device, a significantly higher barrier to breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How FIDO passkeys revolutionize user security with public key cryptography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FIDO passkeys’ architecture is built around a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key stored on the service provider’s server, and a private key securely kept on the user’s device. This design ensures that authentication happens locally, making it significantly more secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how it works:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Registration:</strong> To start using a FIDO passkey, users first need to access the service they want to use it with. This typically involves verifying your identity through an existing method (like a password or an email link) and then initiating the passkey creation. Users begin by registering with a service, where their device creates a new pair of cryptographic keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2288\" height=\"1145\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/registration-process-iag.png\" alt=\"Registration process with FIDO passkeys\" class=\"wp-image-1723\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storing: </strong>The public key is safely stored on the service’s server, while the private key remains secured on the device. The server associates the public key with your account. Your device is now “bound” to your account using this passkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> When users want to log in, the service will ask for the passkey by sending a challenge to their device. Sometimes (depending on the configuration), the users will need to verify their identity to unlock the private key stored on their device to sign the challenge. Successful decryption and response to the challenge verify the user’s identity without transmitting any secret information or the private key itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2289\" height=\"1458\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sign-in_iag.png\" alt=\"Sign-in process with FIDO passkeys\" class=\"wp-image-1726\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages to FIDO Passkeys:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhanced security: </strong>By verifying the user locally, FIDO keeps users and devices safe against phishing, brute force attacks, and other cyber threats.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User convenience: </strong>Simplifies the login process for users, eliminating the need to remember and manage complex passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heightened user trust:</strong> Increases confidence in the platform’s security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduction in data breaches: </strong>Minimizes risks associated with password theft.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost savings: </strong>Lowers the financial impact related to security breaches and <a href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/en_GB/resources/cost-of-a-helpdesk-password-reset/\" rel=\"nofollow\">password resets</a>, which can add up to thousands or millions of dollars per year, depending on the size of the organization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Universal compatibility: </strong>FIDO passkeys can be integrated into a wide range of devices and platforms, allowing users to enjoy advanced security without the need for additional hardware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability and versatility: </strong>FIDO passkeys are adaptable, capable of being deployed across numerous industries, such as finance and e-commerce, and compatible with various platforms, including web and mobile applications.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how FIDO Passkeys compare to traditional authentication methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Feature</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>FIDO Passkeys</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Traditional Authentication</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Authentication Method</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Two-factor, biometric verification</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Password-based</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Security Level</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">High, due to local authentication</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Lower, prone to breaches</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>User Convenience</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">High, no passwords needed</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Low, due to the necessity of password management</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The role of WebAuthn and CTAP in enabling FIDO passkeys</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Authentication (WebAuthn) and Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) standards are what help platforms and services adopt FIDO passkeys in their systems.

This protocol is also very important for enabling FIDO passkeys to function across different platforms, allowing for a more integrated and secure authentication process. CTAP is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), where an additional layer of security is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CTAP is often used in high-risk sectors like banking and healthcare, where the integrity of user authentication processes is critical. In these environments, CTAP&#8217;s role in 2FA is vital, offering an extra security measure that protects sensitive data and user identities from potential threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensuring compatibility: Using passkeys across devices and platforms</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>FIDO passkeys seamlessly integrate with major operating systems, including <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/\" rel=\"nofollow\">macOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linux.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux</a>, as well as mobile platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android</a>. This widespread compatibility means users can enjoy the benefits of passkeys, such as enhanced security and convenience, on virtually any device they own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use FIDO passkeys on virtually any browser, including Chrome, Firefox, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a>, and Edge because they fully support WebAuthn and CTAP protocols. While these browsers are committed to implementing these standards, there might be some variations in support levels, so you need to pay attention to ongoing updates and adjust as needed to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to properly integrate FIDO passkeys, platforms and services need to implement the WebAuthn API and potentially adapt to the latest versions of CTAP. If you’re a developer or an IT professional, we recommend that you stay informed about these evolving standards to ensure compatibility and maximize security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the broad support for FIDO passkeys, challenges still exist, such as discrepancies in protocol implementations across different platforms or browsers. Thankfully, there is a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/fidoalliance.org/g/fido-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">very active FIDO dev community</a> that people can turn to at any point and try to resolve technical issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that besides all the software, you also have hardware authenticators, like <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\">YubiKeys</a>, that enhance the FIDO passkey ecosystem by providing a physical device that stores cryptographic credentials. These devices are compatible with a wide range of operating systems and platforms, offering an additional layer of security, especially in environments where mobile devices are not allowed or practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravatar: Your digital identity management companion in a passkeys world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you passionate about passkeys and eager for a world where passwords no longer exist? We are too! Passkeys, including those built on FIDO standards, are a huge step forward in creating a better internet for the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not the only step forward. If you’re looking into implementing FIDO passkeys on your website or web app, go the extra mile and build a truly robust and complete digital identity management system with <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, an <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> service, is a profile management system that allows people to create Gravatar profiles linked to their email addresses, which they can carry across various apps and platforms such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slack</a>, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the combination of Gravatar and FIDO, you can significantly improve the onboarding process and user experience by allowing people to effortlessly sign up and sign in to your platform without the hassle of remembering multiple passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? A quick and easy sign-up process that saves time, making it a win-win for both users and service providers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, you can use Gravatar&#8217;s API to offer personalized, secure, and privacy-preserving user experiences on your platform.&nbsp;If you want to learn more about how Gravatar can elevate your user experience and security, <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">check out our documentation and subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 16:00:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Gravatar: 10 Proven Strategies for Engaging Users: App Onboarding 101\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=2111\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/09/03/app-onboarding/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27918:\"<p>Have you ever downloaded an app only to feel lost and frustrated within the first few minutes? That&#8217;s where app onboarding comes in. It&#8217;s the digital equivalent of a warm welcome and a guided tour, all rolled into one user-friendly experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, app onboarding is the process of introducing new users to your app&#8217;s interface, features, and benefits. A well-crafted onboarding experience can make the difference between a user who sticks around and one who hits the dreaded uninstall button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong>effective onboarding isn&#8217;t just about showing off your app&#8217;s bells and whistles</strong>. It&#8217;s about helping users understand how your app can solve their problems or make their lives easier. Get it right, and you&#8217;ll see higher user satisfaction, increased engagement, and, ultimately, better retention rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we share the top strategies for creating an onboarding experience that will wow your users and keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why app onboarding is different from web onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Onboarding is onboarding, right?&#8221; – think again. Mobile app onboarding is a whole different ball game compared to its web counterpart. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>User engagement and time constraints</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile users are like hummingbirds – always on the move and easily distracted. They&#8217;re scrolling through apps while waiting for coffee, during commutes, or in between Netflix episodes. This means you&#8217;ve got a smaller window to capture and keep their attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With web onboarding, users might be willing to sit through a longer introduction. But for mobile? <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36256-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research shows</a> that you need to be quick, concise, and to the point. It&#8217;s all about delivering maximum value in minimum time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical constraints and opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile devices come with their own set of challenges and perks. Smaller screens mean you need to be smart about how you present information. Every pixel counts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not all limitations. Mobile apps can tap into device-specific features like push notifications, geolocation, and camera access. These can be powerful tools for creating a more immersive and personalized onboarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consistency across platforms</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where things get tricky. If your app has both mobile and web versions, you need to walk a fine line. The onboarding experience should feel consistent across platforms while still playing to the strengths of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as like translating a book into different languages. The core story stays the same, but you might need to tweak certain elements to make it resonate with each audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top strategies for an engaging app onboarding process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take your app onboarding from good to great? Let&#8217;s dive into some strategies that&#8217;ll have your users saying &#8220;wow&#8221; from the get-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Choose your onboarding strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first – you need to pick the right onboarding strategy. You want to make a great impression, but you also want to be true to your app&#8217;s personality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three popular strategies:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Progressive onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; of the onboarding world. Instead of bombarding users with information, you introduce features gradually as they explore the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prevents information overload.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows users to learn by doing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeps users engaged by revealing features at just the right moment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use tooltips to guide users through features step-by-step.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add gamification elements like progress bars to keep users motivated.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep instructions short and sweet – think bite-sized nuggets of info.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Function-oriented onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy focuses on teaching users how to use your app&#8217;s core features right off the bat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gets users up to speed quickly on essential features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helps users achieve their goals faster.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduces the learning curve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create interactive tutorials for key functions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use video guides or animations to show features in action.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Let users practice in a safe sandbox environment before diving in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Benefits-oriented onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is all about showing users what&#8217;s in it for them. It&#8217;s like answering the question, &#8220;Why should I care about this app?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helps users understand your app&#8217;s unique value proposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Motivates users by showing them what they can achieve.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increases retention by aligning your app&#8217;s value with user needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use welcome screens to showcase key benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include user testimonials or success stories.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalize content to highlight features that align with user goals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Include key onboarding elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve chosen your strategy let&#8217;s talk about the essential elements of a killer onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sign-up page</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your app&#8217;s front door. Make it welcoming and easy to walk through, focusing on clear instructions and encouraging users to finish the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep it simple – ask for only essential information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider offering social media login options.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it visually appealing with a clean design and clear call-to-action buttons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Welcome screen</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your app&#8217;s first impression so make sure it’s inviting, informative, and it includes a brief overview of the app&#8217;s benefits and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use a friendly, welcoming tone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight key benefits and features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalize the message if possible (e.g., &#8220;Hi Sarah, welcome to [App Name]!&#8221;).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interactive walkthrough</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, you need to guide users through your app&#8217;s features in a way that&#8217;s engaging and educational. You can even make it into a game-like experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Break complex features into simple, digestible steps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use tooltips, pop-ups, and animations to guide users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it interactive – let users try features as they learn about them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Feature guidance</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Help users understand and use your app&#8217;s core features effectively. The faster they get to this point, the more they will get out of using your app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use tooltips to provide contextual help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer short, focused tutorials for key features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide on-demand help that users can access when they need it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-serve support</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Empower users to find answers on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a comprehensive knowledge base with articles, FAQs, and video tutorials that users can access anytime.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure your help section is searchable and includes logical categories so it’s easy to navigate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider adding a community forum where users can help each other.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strike a balance: </strong>You want to provide enough guidance to help users get started but not so much that they feel overwhelmed or hand-held. It&#8217;s all about empowering your users to explore and discover the value of your app on their own terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Adapt the onboarding process length to your users</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to app onboarding, there are conflicting opinions about whether it’s a better idea to keep it short and sweet or not. While most people seem to be rushing to get to that “first value”, some experiments show that longer onboarding processes <a href=\"https://www.innertrends.com/blog/onboarding-is-it-a-good-idea-to-get-to-first-value-a-s-a-p\" rel=\"nofollow\">lead to higher conversion and retention rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that just like anything else, a balanced approach is needed – it all comes down to context. Think about your target audience and tailor the process to their requirements. For example, if you have a music app, like <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify</a>, the user’s main goal is to just listen to music, so a lengthy onboarding process doesn’t really make sense. You can add a step where they can select their favorite genres and artists, but beyond that, you’re just making it hard for them to start using your app as intended.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you have a fitness app that offers personalized workouts, you’ll probably need a lot more information from your users such as their fitness goals, current weight and possibilities, exercises they can’t or don’t want to do, number of sessions per week, whether they live in an apartment and need to be quiet or they go to the gym and have access to a lot of equipment, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your case is, there are some universal rules that help make the onboarding uncluttered, which should be the goal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Minimize the number of steps:</strong> Think &#8220;need to know&#8221; vs &#8220;nice to know.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use progressive disclosure:</strong> Reveal features gradually as users need them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make non-essential steps skippable: </strong>Let users decide what they want to learn.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar integration helps reduce sign-up times</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1473\" height=\"918\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravatar-profiles-as-a-service-1.png\" alt=\"Gravatar – Profiles as a Service\" class=\"wp-image-2114\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, short for Globally Recognized Avatar, is a tool that allows people to create consistent <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">digital identities</a> with the same profile picture and basic information across multiple platforms, all linked to their email addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an app developer, you can <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">use the Gravatar REST API</a> to create a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/08/16/user-experience-personalization/\">personalized experience</a> for each user. This means that users can quickly sign up using their existing Gravatar profile, which automatically populates their profile picture and basic info. No more tedious form-filling!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Collect user data at initial stages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collecting user data early on helps you tailor the experience to their preferences and needs, and when you do that, you can enjoy:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personalization through customized content and recommendations</strong>, making your app more relevant to each user.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved retention</strong> because personalized experiences can lead to higher user satisfaction and retention rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency in operations</strong> thanks to early data collection, making your app more intuitive and user-friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the catch – you need to strike a balance between collecting necessary information and not overwhelming the user. It&#8217;s like asking for someone&#8217;s life story on a first date – it&#8217;s too much, too soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also where you can use the Gravatar integration to its full potential. Users can import their name, email, and profile picture from their Gravatar account with just a click because the API will pull this verified information directly from the user&#8217;s profile. This method significantly reduces the risk of errors and friction, so you can increase completion rates and improve user engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s a great way of preventing fake accounts – users are more likely to use their real identities when importing existing profile information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Create skippable elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps in similar niches tend to look and work in familiar ways (project management apps, for example), so if your users are more knowledgeable, they probably won’t need to go through the entire process similar to a complete beginner. This is why it’s always a good idea to add a skip button during the different stages and allow users to control the process based on their preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tactic:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Respects your users’ time:</strong> Some users might already be familiar with similar apps and don&#8217;t need a full tutorial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoids redundancy:</strong> Forcing people through unnecessary steps can lead to frustration and abandonment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Empowers users: </strong>Having control over the learning process can increase engagement and satisfaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Always provide a clear and visible option to skip onboarding steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Utilize a progress bar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Progress bars are the best way to give users a sense of how far they&#8217;ve come and how much is left to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They bring:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Visual representation: </strong>They provide a clear visual of the onboarding process, helping users understand their progress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Psychological benefits: </strong>They create a sense of accomplishment and reduce anxiety, which can increase user engagement and completion rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set expectations: </strong>By showing the number of steps involved, progress bars help users know what to expect from the onboarding process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/\" rel=\"nofollow\">study by the Nielsen Norman Group</a> showed that progress bars can significantly improve user engagement. It&#8217;s like the difference between running a marathon with or without mile markers – knowing how far you&#8217;ve come can be a powerful motivator.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Utilize onboarding checklists</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Checklists aren&#8217;t just for grocery shopping or packing for vacation. For app onboarding, they&#8217;re a powerful tool to ensure users complete essential steps and get the most out of your app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why checklists rock:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Track progress: </strong>They help users keep track of what they&#8217;ve done and what&#8217;s left to do.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide structure:</strong> Checklists break down the onboarding process into manageable steps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Psychological benefits: </strong>There&#8217;s something satisfying about checking off items on a list. It provides a sense of accomplishment and can motivate users to complete the onboarding process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of onboarding checklists as a gentle guide, not a strict rulebook. They should help users navigate your app, not make them feel like they&#8217;re taking a test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Use push notifications strategically</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When used correctly, push notifications can guide, motivate, and engage users throughout their onboarding journey and beyond. But beware: <strong>poorly timed or irrelevant notifications can put users off and even lead them to uninstall.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to make push notifications work for you with some fictional examples from famous apps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Welcome messages: </strong>Start on the right foot with a warm greeting. A language learning app might send something like: &#8220;<em>Bienvenue! Ready to start your French adventure?</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Event-triggered notifications:</strong> Respond to users&#8217; real-time behavior to keep them engaged. If you have a sports app, you can encourage users who have been active throughout the day and maybe offer them some stretching exercises.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Onboarding completion reminders:</strong> Gently nudge users to finish setting up their profiles. For example, LinkedIn often sends notifications like &#8220;<em>Your profile is 70% complete. Add your skills to stand out to recruiters!</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Milestone celebrations:</strong> Acknowledge user progress to boost motivation. Duolingo is very famous just for that and gives its users all sorts of milestones to celebrate, such as learning streaks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-streak.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo 1-day streak milestone\" class=\"wp-image-2115\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personalized tips:</strong> Offer advice based on user behavior. A meditation app might notice a lot of phone activity in times when the device would usually be turned off and send a message saying: &#8220;<em>Having trouble sleeping? Try our new &#8216;Deep Sleep&#8217; story tonight at 10 PM.</em>&#8220;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, always give users control over their notification settings. Nothing turns people off faster than feeling bombarded with messages they can&#8217;t opt out of. Respect their preferences, and they&#8217;re more likely to stay engaged with your app in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Employ regular user testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but definitely not least, don&#8217;t forget about user testing. It&#8217;s like having a focus group for your app, helping you identify pain points and optimize the onboarding flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why user testing is so important:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identify issues:</strong> It helps you spot problems in the onboarding process that you might have overlooked.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gather feedback: </strong>Get actionable insights directly from your target users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous improvement: </strong>Regular testing allows you to refine and enhance the onboarding experience over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different ways to conduct user testing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Moderated testing:</strong> Watch users interact with your app in real time and ask questions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unmoderated testing:</strong> Users complete tasks on their own and provide feedback.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A/B testing:</strong> Compare different versions of your onboarding process to see which performs better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Beta testing: </strong>Release your app to a small group of users before the official launch to gather feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, user testing isn&#8217;t a one-and-done deal. It&#8217;s an ongoing process that helps you keep your onboarding experience fresh, relevant, and effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of apps with great onboarding flows</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some apps that have nailed the onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2116\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo</a>, the popular language learning app, has mastered the art of engaging onboarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fun and engaging:</strong> Duolingo turns the necessary information gathering into a fun, game-like experience.

Your onboarding should be like a good handshake – firm, friendly, and not too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground in this article, from choosing the right onboarding strategy to leveraging tools like progress bars and checklists. But here&#8217;s a pro tip that ties it all together: <strong>consider integrating Gravatar into your onboarding process</strong>. It&#8217;s like having a universal ID for the internet, making sign-ups a breeze, and helping you collect key user data right off the bat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar integration is easier than you might think, and it can significantly streamline your onboarding process.

Welcome to another BizChat on Do the Woo. My name is Marcus Burnette, and I&#8217;m a community marketer with GoDaddy. I&#8217;m here today, as always, with my wonderful co-host from Barn2 Plugins, Katie Keith, and we&#8217;ve roped in the man behind the curtain himself, Bob Dunn. How are you both doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m good, thanks. Good to talk to you, and very exciting to have Bob on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />They let me out of my cage, so it&#8217;s great to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Got to join us every once in a while. Well, we&#8217;re going to be chatting about the WordCamp experience with us coming up and how to make the most of your time and money as a business, whether you&#8217;re attending, sponsoring, or maybe even watching from afar. We can talk about that as well. I was going to say, maybe to start, we&#8217;ll assume for the purposes of this conversation that people know what a WordCamp is and have decided to bring their business. So we&#8217;ll kind of start with that baseline and talk a little bit about just maximizing the time, maximizing the spend, and all of that. How does that sound to you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, that sounds good. Should be interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yep. Awesome. I guess I&#8217;ll just kick it off for all of us to chat about WordCamp as a concept, as a group of sessions, and there are sponsors and there are parties and all of that stuff. How do you balance what to attend, especially when it comes to sessions? There are a lot to choose from, with multiple tracks. How do you pick and choose what makes the most sense to attend at a WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s easy to feel quite torn in many different directions. At the big WordCamps, you&#8217;ve got multiple tracks running alongside each other, and then, of course, all the time there is the hallway track as well. So you need to look at the schedule and think of those maybe four different things—three tracks plus the general networking. Oh, and the sponsor hall, so you could argue that&#8217;s five. Which of those do you do at any given moment? And then, in addition, you&#8217;ve got all the parties. I remember when I started going to WordCamps, it was really just like the after party, but now I think every WordCamp I go to, there are more side events being organized of all different scales by many different companies of different sizes, and a lot of those are open to everybody to register. And I think, in WordCamp Europe this year, there were probably three or four parties running in the same building simultaneously on the first night of the conference. So it was like going between different parties and ethical dilemmas of not being able to attend one after taking a place by registering. So it is a fine juggling act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. I think, especially for anybody new, it is finding that right balance and not totally being worn out by the end of day one or something. It&#8217;s a bit challenging, and you probably want some downtime too, so I think that&#8217;s important. Some of us fill up our cards—or dance cards, per se—and we&#8217;re going from one place to another. I think the sessions are really nice in the sense that not only are they great educationally, but for people that need a little bit of downtime to get out of the social atmosphere, they can just maybe sit and relax. A session is great because you can sit there, you can enjoy, you can learn. So there&#8217;s a lot of stuff. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t make most of the sessions, but I do fill up the side events. I fill up the card on that. I try not to overlap too much where I disappoint somebody if I&#8217;m taking a spot. I don&#8217;t want to be doing that, but yeah, it&#8217;s a hard thing to really… Sometimes it&#8217;s that experience the first time. You&#8217;ve got to see how it goes, and from there on, you start to get what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. A lot of advice I&#8217;ve heard from people is that the sessions will almost always end up online for you to watch later, so skip them and go network. Do you think that is solid advice? Do you think there&#8217;s a worthwhile reason to look at the schedule and find sessions that you probably should attend? You don&#8217;t have the opportunity to ask questions of a speaker necessarily if you&#8217;re watching it later, where you might be able to ask questions during the session. Do you think it&#8217;s worth it? I guess the question is, is that good advice, or should people still look at the schedule and find time to at least attend a few sessions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I feel a bit torn because I recently was a speaker for the first time, but generally, sessions are not an important part of a WordCamp for me. They cover things that you can access at any time of the year, either by reading blog posts or eBooks or real books or listening to podcasts like this. There&#8217;s information, the same as what you get in talks, wherever you look these days. It&#8217;s really excellent how much the WordPress community produces that you can learn from. And then, as you said, Marcus, you can watch things later. There is sort of something to be said for going in person, but I feel that&#8217;s a missed opportunity, and I love what Bob said about it being a kind of break. I go to sessions for an introvert break, and I might learn something, but yeah, that&#8217;s track six. I said there were four or five tracks, and the introvert track is the other one, which might be a wellness room. For me, it&#8217;s often just going back to my hotel room for half an hour for that reason. Actually, I like to stay at the venue if it&#8217;s a hotel where possible because you can just go if you need a bit of a break and then come back down into the thick of it. But I find that the networking, both with people I already know and people I haven&#8217;t met yet, is the most valuable part of attending a WordCamp, and the sessions, therefore, aren&#8217;t as important unless I need a break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />I think that it&#8217;s, again, what you&#8217;re going there for. And I think maybe saying it in the way of that they are online, so being aware that they&#8217;re online if something happens, if you cannot make it, or you get into a conversation you don&#8217;t want to end. That&#8217;s a great alternative because you do have that option. But like Katie said, I think there&#8217;s also some people too that they like to immerse themselves in the actual room, listening to it versus doing it online. So I think it&#8217;s a recommendation more than a suggestion like, &#8220;Hey, you can go there, but if you can&#8217;t make every session, they are online.&#8221; And like you said, everybody&#8217;s going to make their choice. Sometimes I feel really bad when somebody asks me, &#8220;Oh, did you come and see my session?&#8221; And then you fall back, &#8220;Oh, well, I will catch up online.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I do go to sessions if it&#8217;s somebody I know because I&#8217;m supporting them. And it&#8217;s sort of different motivation, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, that makes sense. But it also becomes harder and harder as you get to know more and more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />True, true. We do know a lot of speakers by now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. And you mentioned that you recently were able to be a speaker. One of my questions I had for you, and I&#8217;ll ask Bob too because he&#8217;s been a speaker, do you feel like there&#8217;s a strong business case for applying to speak? Did you feel like, I guess, did you feel like that was worthwhile for your business? Did you do that because you wanted to have that as an accolade, as something that you&#8217;ve done under your belt? Personally, I guess just, and then talking about whether or not people are even attending sessions, is there a good business case for applying and being accepted to speak and being a speaker at a WordCamp event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, it&#8217;s interesting because I didn&#8217;t particularly want to be a speaker, so I do the WP Product Talk podcast with Matt Cromwell and two other people, but Matt particularly invited me to apply with him, and I kind of just said yes without really thinking about it or whether I actually wanted to. I just thought, &#8220;Yeah, that would help promote the podcast. Let&#8217;s go for it.&#8221; And then we were accepted, and I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve never spoken to a big group. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m comfortable with this,&#8221; but I wasn&#8217;t going to drop out or anything. So I did lots of practicing, and it went really well. But reflecting on it afterward, actually, I realized that it was valuable to the business to be a speaker, and particularly in comparison with sponsoring. And I know I upset a few people, which I regret afterward because I tweeted or something that having sponsored the previous year and then being a speaker the following year, I felt that my company had similar exposure from the two things. Also, there were six of my team members walking around in the bright Barn2 T-shirts, and that plus being a speaker and I was on a discussion panel. I tweeted that I felt maybe Barn2 had as much exposure from that as sponsoring. And then lots of people quite rightly got upset that we need to be encouraging people to sponsor and not saying it&#8217;s not necessary. So I would say they are different ways of achieving exposure for your company. Sponsoring is one way, which undeniably does that. But yes, being a speaker does help you get exposure, particularly if you can think of a topic to talk about, which is in some way not directly promotional but is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>relevant to what you do. Because I was talking about how to build a product company, which has nothing to do with the plugins that I sell. So if you can think of something a bit more relevant—if you sell WooCommerce extensions, your talk can be about WooCommerce to help you position yourself as an expert in that field—particularly then I think that could possibly help with sales. Maybe not in the short term, but in the long term, people would recognize you and your company more and be more likely to become a customer. So I would say that there is a business benefit of being a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;d argue that talking about building a product company is relevant in the sense that I like to know who I&#8217;m buying products from, and so knowing you and your company better would be good for business overall. And we&#8217;ll talk about the sponsorship piece in a moment, but I want to give Bob a chance too. Bob, I know your business is a little bit different. You&#8217;re not a product company or an agency, although you&#8217;ve done both of those things too, I believe. Do you feel like there&#8217;s a business case to speaking? Is it just exposure, or is it part of the long-term game—the long game of hoping that people recognize you and want to purchase from you down the line? Or is there maybe a more direct business case for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I think that… I wish I could remember my first time speaking. I need to go to a site that will tell me that, which we&#8217;re all familiar with—Marcus&#8217;s site. But yeah, so it was early. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s 2011, 12, 13 when I did it, and yeah, I forced myself to do it because, at that point, I wasn&#8217;t really into speaking to large groups. I tried to do it at a few other conferences too, but it was personal branding for me. I was doing a lot of training back then, blogging—that was it—basically a lot of training. And for me, it was a good way to brand myself because, obviously, what I talked about was what I talked about in my tutorials or my videos or whatever. So it was certainly something I did for a few years. Then there came a point where I didn&#8217;t really necessarily feel like I didn&#8217;t want to brand myself or continue to brand myself, but I just got to the point where I thought, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m done speaking at WordCamps.&#8221; And I think that decision partly came too because I&#8217;d done it for a few years and so many people apply to those, and I thought, &#8220;Why am I continuing to take up the space there?&#8221; And so I kind of stepped back, and I prefer not speaking now. I enjoy going to WordCamps, but I would encourage anybody to do it and see how it works for you too, personally. It&#8217;s not always the easiest thing for a lot of people to do—to get up and stand in front of a crowd like that. But I&#8217;ve talked to many people who have been very stressed. I&#8217;ll just divert to a little short story. Years ago, I was at a WordCamp, a local WordCamp. There was a guy sitting on the floor, and I&#8217;m not going to mention him, but he&#8217;s very known in the WordPress space. But he was sitting on the floor by himself, and I asked him what was wrong. He looked a little stressed. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking for the very first time, and I don&#8217;t think I should have done this.&#8221; So I sat down on the floor next to him. We just started talking. I said, &#8220;People are pretty forgiving,&#8221; and this was quite a few years ago, but I think they still are. I said, &#8220;Go in there, do your thing.&#8221; And eventually, he did. I don&#8217;t know if I really made him feel any better about it, but afterward, somebody did come up to me and, without even asking them, they said, &#8220;Hey, the guy was a little nervous, but boy, the information was great. He did a really good job.&#8221; So I went back and told him. I thought he should hear that, and he did smile. He said, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s great to know.&#8221; But yeah, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve got to… For a lot of people, you make yourself do it, but I think it&#8217;s, again, it really depends on the person and if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re comfortable with and if you feel you really want to build that brand, whether it&#8217;s your company&#8217;s brand or your personal brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, if your profile is up to date fully, your first talk was in 2011 at WordCamp Seattle, so, oh wow, been a little bit, but you&#8217;ve spoken plenty of times since then. Yeah, I spoke as well last year, I think it was, at WordCamp Phoenix, and I appreciated, I guess, the exposure. I appreciated the way that it opened up opportunities for people to ask you questions. I think that was more beneficial than most anything else was. Now you&#8217;re a name on the sheet and a face that people have seen that, for better or for worse, makes you an expert in at least the topic that you were talking about, but also by the nature of it, a WordPress expert in the WordPress expert circle. And so it gives opportunities for you to have people approach you and ask questions and say, &#8220;I want to learn more about X, Y, Z.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re a business, that opens up doors for you to talk about, like Katie was saying, if your talk was about something related to your business, there&#8217;s obviously an open door there to then talk about some of the products or services that you sell as well—to say, &#8220;Hey, I understand that problem. I&#8217;ve come across it lots of times. We&#8217;ve actually built a product that helps with that problem. Let me tell you about it.&#8221; And the sales process kind of comes to you a little bit in that regard, and I think that&#8217;s helpful as well. It is something that you have to apply and be accepted for. So let&#8217;s talk about the other direction, which is sponsorship, which you pay into as a business. You can also pay to be a sponsor. That guarantees you a spot in the sponsor hall, whatever that may look like. It&#8217;s a little different based on the size of the conference, but that gets you guaranteed access to attendees to talk a little bit about what you do. I don&#8217;t want to open the controversy box again with Katie there on whether you should or shouldn&#8217;t, but maybe we can talk a little bit about the business case for sponsoring a little bit and what do you get? I know that Katie, you&#8217;ve sponsored in the past. Bob, I know that you&#8217;ve sponsored in the past. I&#8217;m part of the GoDaddy team that sponsors globally all of the WordCamps, so maybe we can chat just a little bit about the business case for sponsoring WordCamp events. We&#8217;ll start with you, Katie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think we can all agree, and this is well-documented now, that sponsoring does not generate enough direct sales in the short term to cover the cost of sponsorship. However, there are still other benefits, particularly if you have the kind of marketing strategy and accompanying budget where you are going for general brand awareness within the WordPress community, which, for example, hosting companies—that&#8217;s very important that they&#8217;re seen to be big players, support the community, and so on. Being there has a symbolic importance, as well as directly getting people to know your brand over time. So I think there are benefits, but you shouldn&#8217;t sponsor a WordCamp if you think it&#8217;s going to generate more sales than it costs straight away and that you&#8217;ll be able to measure that. Last year, when I sponsored for the first time, I did a sale—a 50% off sale—and gave everybody leaflets with coupon codes, and we made literally zero sales from that. And I know because nobody used that coupon; I can track that. So it is not a direct ROI, but people must be more familiar with our brand. Hundreds and hundreds of people talked to us over the two days. We did product demos. Existing customers asked questions which might have helped to boost their loyalty over time and their likelihood of being retained and renewing. There are lots of indirect benefits, but you&#8217;re never going to measure them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Do the Woo sponsored, and actually several people came up to me and asked me, &#8220;Why are you sponsoring?&#8221; They couldn&#8217;t quite understand it because I am not selling a product. I&#8217;m basically saying, &#8220;Hey, come and listen to our shows.&#8221; And I thought about it long and hard. I had a little experience with being able to take over a booth at WordCamp US last year. So then, after that experience, I decided to try WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe. And one thing is, yeah, your expectations—you&#8217;ve got to understand what to expect and can this bring enough value to you for brand awareness? And that was one big part of it, to make people aware of the podcasts. I&#8217;d also… It&#8217;s easy to say, &#8220;Hey, go spend whatever amount of money out there you need to spend to be a sponsor.&#8221; But I also had my sponsors. I talked to them about me sponsoring at least a couple of the flagship sponsorships, so I got that money through my sponsorships where I could sponsor, which is kind of meta. But anyway, it was incredibly valuable for me because of not just being a podcast but being what the podcast stands for within the community. I mean, it became more of a community table. I know that Katie was able to spend some time at it, and people would just come up and talk about things. They don&#8217;t always need to talk about a podcast show. Katie was catching people she maybe hadn&#8217;t seen yet because we were in a very nice location, especially at WordCamp Europe, where people were passing by. And I had several</p>\n\n\n\n<p>people later on say, &#8220;Hey, I was going to stop by and say hi, but there were so many people around your booth that I just thought, well, maybe I can catch you another time.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;We just saw you constantly busy,&#8221; and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily, again, selling or talking about the podcast endlessly, but when somebody would be able to come up and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s your podcast about?&#8221; I had all these stickers out for the different shows, and so I&#8217;d get talking to them. I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well, what do you do?&#8221; I&#8217;d give them the sticker of the show that I thought fit them because they maybe wouldn&#8217;t want to listen to them all. So it was a very good investment for me and a good investment for the growth. I think Katie said something like, &#8220;If you can find the right strategy and you find the value and the value equals what you have to spend,&#8221; especially in the case of Katie or GoDaddy. I mean, I set myself up, and I was basically it, and then some of the hosts were there. But you&#8217;ve got a team that you&#8217;ve got to fly there or whatever. You&#8217;ve got a team that you&#8217;ve got to put in the hotels, feed, all this stuff. So there&#8217;s a lot of added expense besides just that dollar amount you&#8217;re looking at for the sponsorship. So it&#8217;s a good value if you know what you&#8217;re getting into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />For something like WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t even want to talk about the amount of money that GoDaddy spends to sponsor and have team members and all of that there. And the ROI is impossible to either track long-term or make up in immediate sales. WordCamps are generally not sales events. We aren&#8217;t salesy. When people come up to the booth, we&#8217;re happy to talk about the things that we&#8217;re doing with WordPress and GoDaddy and share as much information as people are interested in listening to, but it&#8217;s not a sales event. We all kind of know that, and so making that up is nearly impossible. That being said, and we could probably do an entire episode—or I think maybe we even have done an episode—about why or why not to sponsor, there&#8217;s another part to sponsoring WordCamp in the sense that one of the big reasons that we&#8217;re global sponsors and continue to be large sponsors at flagship events is just to show the community that we&#8217;re here and invested in the community. There&#8217;s clearly an investment cost there that isn&#8217;t recouped in sales. That is just us saying, &#8220;We want to see this project, this ecosystem, this community succeed. We&#8217;re going to put our dollars behind it and show up and show up big and have lots of people come with us to meet the community and be part of the community and contribute, to be part of Contributor Day and all of that stuff.&#8221; That being said, I also wonder kind of the flip side that I always ask myself and ask people when we start to talk about whether we should or shouldn&#8217;t be at any particular WordCamp is: is there a cost to not being at a WordCamp? We&#8217;ve clearly discussed not financial, but kind of like a reputation cost. Does showing up one year and not showing up the next year look like, &#8220;Oh no, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with that company. They must not be doing well. They decided not to sponsor. Were they not able to sponsor? Are they pulling back from the community?&#8221; That kind of thing. I wonder what you both think about that, if there are thoughts of what the cost is to not being a sponsor, especially, I guess, if you&#8217;ve been a sponsor before. I guess if you&#8217;ve never been a sponsor, then are you irrelevant already is the first question. And if you were a sponsor and then you aren&#8217;t a sponsor in the future, is there a level of people thinking that you&#8217;re on your way to irrelevance? I don&#8217;t know. I think there&#8217;s a psychological piece to it too, and I wonder what you all think about that, whether there&#8217;s a cost of not being a sponsor or not being there at all. Katie, I know that you weren&#8217;t a sponsor, but you still showed up and were there and were a speaker and had a team there, and they were walking around in their shirts, so clearly not irrelevant, clearly there to support the community. But I wonder if there&#8217;s a cost to not showing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think it depends on your line of work. I think the main types that can be hurt by not sponsoring are hosting companies because it&#8217;s almost like an arms race to show who&#8217;s the biggest and has the biggest booth. Does the type of booth fit with people&#8217;s perceptions of your scale of company? And it can go both ways, so you kind of do need to choose wisely both whether to just not be sponsoring and, if you are, is it going to make you look good or bad basically. Whereas I think there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a small booth if you are a small company. Like at Barn2, I feel it fits our reputation or whatever. I don&#8217;t think, as far as I know, any eyebrows will be raised by having the small booth. Same with Do the Woo—it&#8217;s a community booth; you&#8217;re not a product company, Bob. So I think it makes sense for you to have that level, but the big companies need to think about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />That&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;ve thought of it, but I&#8217;ve never thought of it in the question that Marcus said because it is perception. And I guess where that perception comes from is probably more for the core community too, is the people that see you all the time and know about you all the time as opposed to maybe new people in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting for sure, and as someone who is largely in charge of running a big booth for a hosting company at flagship events and stuff, it&#8217;s definitely something that we do think about. What is the perception? What is the perception in the giveaways that we&#8217;re giving away? I mean, there&#8217;s definitely the perception aspect to all of it. The design of the booth has to be on par with a large brand or whatever. Sometimes that&#8217;s good, sometimes that&#8217;s bad. Sometimes we want to look more corporate than we are. Sometimes we want to look less corporate than we are—more approachable, less approachable—and there&#8217;s just a lot that goes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />It&#8217;s interesting. That could actually flow over into the perception of side events too. Why is this person doing this huge side event and this hosting company is having a smaller whatever? Is that another perceived idea that, oh, they&#8217;re kind of cutting back because of whatever? Speaking of side events, I&#8217;m curious, and this kind of gets away a little bit from the sponsorship, but I was talking to Katie a little bit about it: do either of you ever strategically plan side events? Is it just, &#8220;Hey, I am going to sign up for this one, this one; I&#8217;m going to do this,&#8221; and just party or meet people and have fun, or is there some other little method to your madness?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, in my case, I&#8217;m on the clock at camps basically from the time that my plane touches down to when I get back to the airport and head out. And so the side events, for me, are just as much hallway track and networking as any other part of the event, but it is definitely far more casual and easier to jump into conversations. The networking doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean we&#8217;re talking business, but I am getting to know people, creating those relationships and forming friendships with people that I&#8217;ve seen at a few camps and deepening relationships with people that I&#8217;ve seen for the first time or people that I&#8217;ve talked to online a bunch of times and we finally get to meet up in person. So a part of it is trying to figure out where are some of the people that I want to have conversations with going? What are their plans, where are they headed? Some of it is knowing some of the other side event organizers and them asking me specifically, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;d love for you to drop by.&#8221; And then I try to make an attempt to make it to those events. There comes a time where there&#8217;s so many of them that they sort of overlap or even are in the same building, and then you&#8217;re playing that classic TV show where you&#8217;re trying to be in two or three places at once. So you&#8217;re zipping out the back door to drop down to another party for 30 minutes, and then you&#8217;re coming back up, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I just went to the bathroom real quick,&#8221; and trying to keep conversations going and stuff. As far as strategy-wise goes, I&#8217;m there at those to basically just deepen relationships and talk to people and have a good time. And obviously, the benefits of that spill out past the WordCamp event, where I can have conversations back online with folks but know them a little bit better and their personalities and all of that and have better conversations and stuff. As far as time management strategies, that&#8217;s so difficult because you have to map out where each of the events are and what time they&#8217;re happening and when they start and when they end and how far one is from the other. And I don&#8217;t have energy for all of that, but I try to make sure that I&#8217;m getting to the events, especially if someone has specifically asked me, like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to be at this event, and I&#8217;d like to chat with you for some time. Are you going to be there? Would you make it there?&#8221; And then I&#8217;ll try to make it there, and I&#8217;ll have a conversation with those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I think with the side events, my strategy has definitely relaxed over the years. When I first started going to WordCamp, I would always make a point of wearing the T-shirt to all the side events. Even costume things like the after parties would often say, &#8220;Wear a costume.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Nope, I want to be in my Barn2 T-shirt, and I want it to say on</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the front and the back what my company is because then people are more likely to come up to me if they know who we are.&#8221; And I think if you are trying to raise awareness and you don&#8217;t know that many people, that is a good strategy. I don&#8217;t particularly do that anymore at the side events because I&#8217;m all networked out by then after the daytime when I was wearing the T-shirt. And I know enough people that there will be people to talk to all evening without needing to advertise my company, and people know me more anyway from the podcast and Twitter and what photos and whatever. So I don&#8217;t do that, but I would recommend it if you&#8217;re just starting out. And also, the parties vary in terms of how loud they are, and really it&#8217;s best to view them as networking events. So the after party… Everybody constantly feeds back that they need a quiet room, but they&#8217;re often very bad at that. They were fine this year at WordCamp US; it was in a museum again like last year’s. But the WordCamp Europe after party was too loud this year, for example, despite feedback saying that they needed quieter areas. So if you just want to talk to people and network, find the quieter parties, which you can do by thinking about the location. Is it a nightclub, or is it in a restaurant or a cocktail bar or something that&#8217;s going to be quieter? So that&#8217;s good. And I heard an interesting tip, which I&#8217;ve never implemented, which is that if you&#8217;ve got multiple team members, send different team members to different side events so that your team has representation across more of the community. I think that&#8217;s kind of a shame because one of the big benefits of WordCamps that we haven&#8217;t talked about is bringing your team together. It may be that you don&#8217;t have company retreats; we don&#8217;t have company retreats. We just bring each team member to their local flagship WordCamp, and that&#8217;s a really good bonding experience for people. And so that&#8217;s another reason to go to WordCamp. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want to separate them out at a side event, but I can see the business benefit in terms of marketing of doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, at least I thought I&#8217;m like Marcus—if somebody says, &#8220;Are you going to be at this event? I&#8217;d love to talk,&#8221; I truly try to make an effort to be there. And I&#8217;m a little bit more lax on, as long as I&#8217;m not, like I said before, overlapping and not showing up. I sign up for quite a few of them because I also find that often the opportunity comes to meet somebody that I haven&#8217;t met yet at WordCamp—maybe catching up or someone I don&#8217;t know at all—just happened to run into them, say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to this event because I know more people at it or because of the brand or whatever.&#8221; I find myself signing up for just about any event that comes my way that I have time for because what else am I going to be doing—sitting in my room or something? So I might as well be out meeting people. So yeah, I don&#8217;t necessarily have much of a strategy. I do find that I do end up leaving if I can&#8217;t hear what somebody&#8217;s saying. I think one party in Athens—I don&#8217;t know where it was—I damaged my hearing even more than it already is, but it&#8217;s hard to communicate for some of us in those situations, and I will likely make my way to another party if it becomes a point where I just cannot have a conversation at all. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to all depend on what works for you and what is right for you and some of that stuff. I&#8217;ve had people actually say to me that they went to a side event and they found out it was almost too overwhelming, even more so than the WordCamps. There was just too much socializing, and they were ready for some downtime and stuff. So you&#8217;ve just got to kind of play it by ear and decide what works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. My last side event question was going to be, we sort of all agree that there are good networking opportunities. Do you tend to talk shop at those or not? Or does it depend? Are you looking to just hang out and get to know people who they are a little bit better? Are you offended if people come up to you and ask to talk shop? How do you handle those conversations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I go with the flow. I&#8217;m happy to do either and to allow people to lead. Sometimes I&#8217;ll be meeting new people, and you may end up talking shop because you&#8217;ve done perhaps some collaboration with them in the past online and you&#8217;ve not met in person, or you might use it as a chance to get to know each other personally, which helps to strengthen your professional relationship. Or at other side events, I end up speaking with people I already know well and already know everything about their businesses. So we would be talking about other things then. So I think, unless you have a really clear strategy, which is fine, you can go with the flow and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Whatever way the wind blows, however it works. Although it was very ironic that the first three flagships I went to after we moved to Portugal, 90% of the people who walked up to me, the first question out of their mouth was, &#8220;How is Portugal?&#8221; So I repeated that story numerous times for three different flagship WordCamps—at least probably, yeah, maybe hundreds of times and stuff. So I didn&#8217;t talk shop a lot because people didn&#8217;t care about that. All they wanted to know was how the move and how Portugal went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That&#8217;s what happens if you&#8217;re famous and have an interesting story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. I know we could go on and on. Is there a little tip or strategy that you&#8217;ve found works, that doesn&#8217;t kind of fall into the norm, or something that just helps people who are going and trying to navigate whether it&#8217;s their first time or they&#8217;re within their first few WordCamps that they&#8217;re still trying to find out the right thing to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, so I&#8217;ll take it from the introvert&#8217;s perspective because, as weird as it is for me to have a job where I go to WordCamps and talk to people, I am more introverted by nature. So what I do—what I find is extremely helpful—is I&#8217;ll get wherever the camp is, at least kind of the day before everything starts happening, and give myself a few hours to just leave on my own and go explore the city, go explore just outside the city. If there&#8217;s a WordCamp US in Portland this year, there are great places to go hiking and see some stuff outdoors as well. Just get away from everyone else for a couple of hours because the entire event is going to be very &#8220;peopley.&#8221; You&#8217;re going to be non-stop talking to people from the time that registration starts to the time that the side event after party or whatever ends. And so you&#8217;re talking at least a day, but in many cases, multiple days worth of just being around, being surrounded by people and talking to people constantly. And so I generally try to just get away for a couple of hours by myself. I&#8217;ll grab either my camera or just have my phone on me and just go out away and take pictures and walk around and just enjoy the silence, I guess, for a little bit. And then that really prepares me to be in a headspace to talk to people for many hours at a time. And so I highly recommend doing that for anyone who&#8217;s mildly introverted, I guess, just to give yourself some time to be on your own before you get into being around everyone else for that long of a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, that definitely applies to the majority of people who attend WordCamps as well, probably unlike conferences in some other industries. But that is definitely the case with WordCamp attendees as a whole. So my advice would be to do with networking. If you don&#8217;t already know people at a WordCamp, you need to understand it&#8217;s the sort of place you can just go up to somebody and talk to them. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you say—just, &#8220;Oh, hey, I&#8217;m so-and-so, what do you do?&#8221; People are open to that. And I&#8217;d say this even as a woman in a male-dominated industry. People don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strange if you just go up to people and talk to them. They also don&#8217;t act inappropriately. It&#8217;s just everybody is friendly, accepts that it&#8217;s a networking event, and you can do that. So even if you are quite shy and you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp before, do that because I think you could listen to Marcus and say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know anyone. I&#8217;m not going to spend all day talking.&#8221; Actually, you should just go into the sponsor hall and go up to the sponsors. You may get into conversations with people near the sponsor booths as well. That&#8217;s a good place for networking if you don&#8217;t already know people. So do end up talking to people and try and remember them. I&#8217;m really bad at this. You talk to so many people, and then you&#8217;re probably going to have some kind of contact through collaborations or link exchanges or whatever kind of partnership work you do with other people—or hiring them or being hired by them or any of these things. At some point in the future, they may well remember you and you don&#8217;t remember them. And that happens to me all the time. And so try and write down who you&#8217;ve talked to or something and keep that because you never know when you need a bit of help with the memory. Overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, good to take a picture of a selfie or take a picture of them. Then you can zoom in on their name tag if it&#8217;s not flipped over, and you can see their name at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Good advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve done that a few times. And a little bit of piggyback on the networking. What I always tell people is visit all the vendors, all the sponsors, and it&#8217;s kind of two-part. One is, they&#8217;re not going to be, like Marcus said, none of them are like these huge high-pressure sales pitches you may have experienced at other conferences that you&#8217;ve gone to. They do like to talk, and you never know what will happen in a conversation. That&#8217;s just what Katie was saying—going up and talking to people. You never know what kind of connection you&#8217;re going to make, what may happen down the road, what kind of friendship you might build. So make sure and do that. And another thing I learned early on to do is as you&#8217;re looking at the sponsor list, if there&#8217;s a sponsor that you&#8217;re not familiar with, there is a new name, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Especially some of the smaller sponsors will be that way,&#8221; and you think, &#8220;Oh, is this somebody I should know about?&#8221; Go and check out their website. And if it&#8217;s somebody that you think would be worth getting to know better, or maybe it&#8217;s a product or a service that you&#8217;re thinking you&#8217;d really find valuable, learn a little bit about their business—just enough to be able to walk up to them and not say, &#8220;Hey, what do you do?&#8221; Say, &#8220;Hey, I checked out your site, and I noticed you do these couple of things, and I&#8217;m kind of interested in that one part of it.&#8221; And probably a lot of sponsors will go, &#8220;Wow, this person actually took the time,&#8221; and the conversation&#8217;s going to go a lot more smoothly. And you don&#8217;t want to do that with every sponsor—do the research—but there might be some that maybe you want to become an affiliate, maybe you want to… Something you have in your mind, you might segue into a conversation knowing a little bit about them better than just asking, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s good advice. And linked to that, we haven&#8217;t mentioned the attendee list that you can read through—a list of the people who are going beforehand. It&#8217;s a long list. There are thousands of people on it, but if you are just starting out and you don&#8217;t know who you want to meet with, it&#8217;s a really good idea, I think, to spend half an hour reading through it and just seeing what names jump out at you. It might be individuals&#8217; names that, I don&#8217;t know, you follow on Twitter or have had some kind of contact with or seen in a podcast or doing a talk at a previous WordCamp. Anything to make you recognize them and think maybe you want to reach out beforehand and arrange to connect with them. Or alternatively, you might recognize their company name and think, actually, yeah, I could get some business benefit from having an in-person connection with someone from that company. So the attendee list is another way to do that as well as the sponsors. So that&#8217;s been great. I think we&#8217;ve covered a lot of different angles of how to get the most out of a WordCamp, whether you are sponsoring, speaking, or just attending. So I hope everybody has a great time at WordCamp US, and we&#8217;ll all be there. And yeah, I hope it&#8217;s useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this <strong>Woo BizChat, Marcus Burnette, Katie Keith, and BobWP</strong> dive into how to get the most out of <strong><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCampUS</a></strong>, whether you’re sponsoring, speaking, or just attending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about balancing sessions with networking, especially through side events, and the long-term perks of building connections in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, they share some useful tips for introverts and newcomers on how to navigate WordCamps and make the experience as rewarding as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing WordCamp Activities</strong>: Attendees should consider balancing session attendance with networking opportunities, such as hallway tracks and side events. Sessions can often be viewed later online, so focusing on networking might provide more immediate value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Networking Strategy</strong>: It&#8217;s important to be open to meeting new people and networking, even for introverts. Approaching sponsors and other attendees can lead to valuable connections and collaborations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speaking at WordCamps</strong>: Speaking at WordCamps can be a great way to build personal and company branding, even if it doesn&#8217;t directly lead to immediate business. It&#8217;s also a good opportunity to support the community and share expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sponsorship Considerations</strong>: Sponsorships are more about brand awareness and community involvement than immediate sales ROI. However, sponsors should be mindful of the perception their presence (or absence) may create within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Side Events</strong>: Side events are valuable for casual networking and building relationships. Attendees might consider which events to attend based on who they want to connect with and the atmosphere of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preparation Tips</strong>: For newcomers or those who are introverted, it&#8217;s helpful to take some time alone before the event, research sponsors and attendees, and approach networking in a relaxed, go-with-the-flow manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Strategy</strong>: If attending with a team, consider spreading out across different side events to maximize the company’s presence and networking opportunities, though it’s also important to use the event as a team-building experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"Do The Woo Community: Welcome Our New Sponsor Kinsta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=85506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/welcome-our-new-sponsor-kinsta/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2429:\"<p>Hey everyone!

The porn ban didn’t help matters, but the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/15/is-the-exodus-over-heres-how-twitter-alternatives-have-fared-since-elon-musks-acquisition/\">Twitter Exodus</a> of early 2023 following Elon Musk’s acquisition of the social media site gave it a sudden boost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration announcement post said, “We’re not talking about changing Tumblr. We’re not turning Tumblr into WordPress. That would defeat the purpose. We acquired Tumblr to benefit from its differences and strengths, not to water it down. We love Tumblr’s streamlined posting experience and its current product direction. We’re not changing that. We’re talking about running Tumblr’s backend on WordPress. You won’t even notice a difference from the outside.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://x.com/automattic/status/1829097044549489008\">reiterated</a> that<strong> “The changes will be exclusively at the backend.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration though not easy &#8211; with Tumblr hosting over half a billion blogs &#8211; will be a win-win situation for both WordPress and Tumblr. Automattic believes that “Tumblr will benefit from the collective effort that goes into the open source WordPress project. And WordPress will benefit from the tools and creativity we invest into Tumblr and contribute back to WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Men Wanted for Hazardous Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic is actively seeking experienced PHP programmers to undertake this migration project. Matt compared this to the famous British explorer Ernest Shackleton’s recruitment ad for his Antarctic expedition, which read, “Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/tumblr-migration/\">advertisement continues</a>, “If you’re an experienced programmer… if you’re a SQL‑slinger… if you’ve worked on other big audacious projects like this… if Gordian knots tremble in your presence, we want to work with you!”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;We’re already seeing interesting candidates apply and resume review is underway for full-time roles. All relevant experience is welcome, particularly those who have worked on other large migrations or are just excited about working on a challenge of this size.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Bob Ralian, Tumblr Migration Lead</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested candidates can apply through the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/tumblr-migration/\">website</a> giving a brief introduction about themselves.

I hope this means it becomes easier to create Tumblr themes in the future; especially, dare I say, if they’re just block themes…” <a href=\"https://x.com/courtneyr_dev/status/1828979569581298069\">Courtney Robertson</a>, Open Source Developer Advocate at GoDaddy, also hopes to see more “ block themes supporting post formats SOON.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head of WP Relations at Elementor, <a href=\"https://x.com/miriamschwab/status/1829058002520789443\">Miriam Schwab</a> dubbed it “The ultimate &#8220;data liberation&#8221; project” while Developer Advocate WPEngine <a href=\"https://x.com/dcook/status/1829204853790519320\">Damon Cook </a>speculated, “I wonder if there will be outcomes from this large migration that could overlap and help solve pieces of the Data Liberation project.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product Designer <a href=\"https://x.com/ybhrdwj/status/1829030113402355723\">Yash Bhardwaj </a>was excited ”This will go down in history books similar to some ancient empire conquering another.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nickweisser/status/1829461378588950606\">Nick Weisser</a> of Openstream is optimistic “This would represent a significant increase in the market share of #WordPress, pushing it from around 43% to over 60%?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure no one foresaw these developments when Jeff Chandler wrote “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-be-more-tumblr-like\">WordPress To Be More Tumblr Like</a>” in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:18:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: State of CSS 2024 Survey Now Open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160779\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-css-2024-survey-now-open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2802:\"<p>The annual <a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/the-2024-state-of-css-survey-is-now-open-4o5h\">State of CSS 2024</a> Survey is officially open. The survey aims to explore the “world of styles and selectors to try and identify upcoming trends, and figure out what features and tools to learn next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organized by Devographics, with support from contributors, translators, and volunteers, the survey is open to everyone. CSS users are encouraged to <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2024\">take the survey </a>by September 7, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s survey introduces several new features and takes around 15-20 minutes to complete, with all questions being optional. The survey covers 11 key topics, including Layout, Shapes and Graphics, Colors, Interactions, Accessibility, and a concluding ‘About You’ section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2019, the survey has grown in popularity, with 9,190 developers participating last year. Some insights from the previous survey include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Most participants were from the USA, followed by Germany and the UK.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61.3% of respondents identified as male, 7.7% as female, and 1.4% as non-binary or gender non-conforming.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS topped the list in terms of usage, while Tailwind CSS and PureCSS led in retention.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CSS was primarily used for web apps, blogs, and marketing sites.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subgrid was the most commented feature, Open Props the technology with the highest percentage of returning users and Panda the tool most mentioned in freeform questions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey data is valuable for browser vendors, influencing their focus areas and roadmaps. Rachel Andrew, content lead for web.dev and developer.chrome.com at Google, <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/state-of-css-2024\">shared </a>that the State of CSS survey is one of the methods they use to learn what&#8217;s important to the developers. “These surveys let you tell us exactly what you are using, and what you want to use but can&#8217;t due to bugs or lack of support.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s been a while since I talked to you about the digital divide. In case you&#8217;re a brand new listener, check out episode 17, and actually everyone, just go check out episode 17 because bridging the digital divide, teaching people how to embrace technology fully and how to make it work for you, is one of the primary motivators of my decisions in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> WordPress&#8217;s unique position as both a tool that&#8217;s ubiquitous in its use and a community that is all-encompassing in its skill set means that if you know a bit about how open source works, you can use it as a tool to learn digital literacy and practice technical skills. Even though this is one of my primary motivators, I have never actually succeeded at getting WordPress into schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, it&#8217;s not for lack of interest from the community; it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s hard to fit into curriculum-based learning. After all, we&#8217;ve had ways to learn WordPress for as long as we&#8217;ve had ways to use WordPress. It&#8217;s just that it takes a long time to design instructional material, even when you know the content like the back of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And open source stuff just moves really quickly. However, that didn&#8217;t stop us from spending years refining the content that we do have into the learning pathways you can now find on learn.WordPress.org. If you&#8217;re an educator, you can use those almost out of the box. But if you&#8217;ve got learners in your home and want to make a case for why their school should bring a little WordPress based digital literacy into the classroom, I&#8217;ve got five good arguments for you for why they should give us a chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first one, as I mentioned before, WordPress as a tool is practically ubiquitous. It powers a significant portion of the web, so it&#8217;s easy to find examples to aspire to and content creators for guidance. And given that it is so prevalent, knowing WordPress ensures that students are well prepared for a wide range of job opportunities in the digital industry, making them more competitive in the job market overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is that WordPress is a free and open source piece of software. In our case, it&#8217;s free in both meanings of the word. Free, as in no cost and no constraints. That means students have freedom to experiment with the code and with the design, which gives you that feeling of joyous experimentation that a lot of us had at the start of the web before there were CMSs. It taps into a different kind of creativity that results in technical curiosity and, ultimately, growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that the best way to learn WordPress happens to also align with the concept of project-based learning, which is one of the best methods for learning in general. I believe that to be true. I&#8217;m not an educator, but I really believe that project-based learning is the best way to learn complex topics. It&#8217;s an active way to learn. You get a bunch of tactical skills in there, like development, alongside the basics of good collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Obviously, these are all skills that are directly valuable in the workplace, but I have also found them profoundly useful in my day-to-day existence. You know, as a human participating in a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four is a bit of a spicy nugget, but WordPress is essential for creating and managing digital content, which is table stakes right now. That&#8217;s a foundational skill for most web dev jobs, but also marketing, journalism, and communications. And beyond that, everyone knows that your best leaders are the people who can tell a compelling story based on the information they have. The ones who can connect the dots in a way that makes it matter to you. This is a spicy, of course, because of the confusing do si do that AI is taking with the content landscape. But I believe that people are the best storytellers, and stories are what keep us all moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing is that there is a whole wide world of open source. There are so many products and projects that use an open source license, right? Like you, listener, I can guarantee I don&#8217;t even know who you are, but I can guarantee that you use at least one item a day that has some open source thing in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of these open source projects are international. They&#8217;re developed on a global scale across numerous countries by people with various levels of education. And it&#8217;s this vastness of scope, this broadness of connection, that will give you, give your student, a chance to understand how to work across cultures, how to build something that is more than the sum of its parts, and how to embrace the concept of altruistic generosity that leads to a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Because just as I&#8217;m sure that you, a complete stranger, touched something open source today, I&#8217;m equally sure that the people we bring into open source will be able to solve the biggest problems of tomorrow with better connections and more skill because of what we taught them here today.&nbsp;If all of this sounds compelling, but you&#8217;re not ready to, like, go into your school administrator, your superintendent, your local, I don&#8217;t know, education board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this felt right, but you don&#8217;t know for sure, and you want a little bit more experience with it before you go advocate for it yourself, I will have in the show notes over on WordPress.org, I&#8217;ll have in the show notes of this podcast a series of events that are coming up. We have a couple that have already gone by WPCampus, I think just wrapped up a few weeks ago. But there are a handful of events that are happening across the world that is specific to youth wanting to learn technology, working with WordPress to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then educators as well. You can also always stop by the Training Team and ask them questions about how this all works, why it works together their philosophies behind their learning pathways. There are so many ways that you can get answers to the questions that you might have about why open source, and especially WordPress, is worth trying to get your students exposed to and working in and contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings me, now that I have finished with my little soapbox, to our small list of big things. Gosh, I hope you all missed hearing teeny tiny rants about WordPress and open source from me over the break that I took in August, but before you respond to that, feel free to respond to me in any comments. Let&#8217;s first get to the small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, the full WordCamp US schedule has been released, so if you&#8217;re planning to attend that, you can take a look and get your schedule, your personal schedule, for the week figured out. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence, there might be a speaker or two in there that tips the scales for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program Cohort number three, the third one, will happen in Q4 this year. The call for mentors and mentees has just been completed. But you should keep an eye out on September 9th, I think. So, at the end of this week, the final list will be announced. This program has been excellent for mentors to give back to the community while enhancing their leadership skills. And the mentees who participate have received personalized guidance and a chance to develop skills and network within the community, and a good portion of them continue to contribute to WordPress itself and other open source projects that we rely on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that YouTube has been an essential platform for sharing complex ideas with a diverse audience. And our WordPress YouTube channel is no exception. It has been slowly warming itself up. We have a team that&#8217;s warming up the content over there. WordCamp information gets on it now. But in keeping with our commitment to meeting the needs of both current and future users, just making sure that we meet people where they are, I&#8217;m excited to announce that Jamie Marsland will be taking on the management of the WordPress YouTube channel. So for anyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, stop by and say hello to Jamie in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, I have a really important call to action. So, we are still working to reactivate our meetup groups. The Community Team is driving that charge, and they need your help to reactivate any group that&#8217;s inactive. Last month, a list of groups was shared and marked for removal from our chapter program. And we requested responses by August 5th to keep those groups active, but due to the summer holiday, we have extended it a little bit. We&#8217;ve extended it to September 16th, which, if I am remembering my calendar correctly, is a couple weeks from now. So if your group is on that pending closure list, email support@wordcamp.org to let us know if you want to reactivate the group or if you are ready to step down and have a new leader show up, and we can help you figure out how to get that done. Either way, if you&#8217;re on the list, email us let us know what your hopes and, dreams, and plans are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:58]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

Is that news?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, in an episode a bit ago, <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/unpacking-blogging-a-blogstorm-with-ronald-gijsel-and-bobwp/\">Ronald and I chatted about this</a> during our Blogstorm</strong> and shared what it means to us and what we plan on doing with this blog. The fact the site was sans blog for sometime, well, that&#8217;s another story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially you will see that there are already <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/\">some posts here</a></strong> that were, well, moved over to BobWP.com and now have returned here, their original home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a soft relaunch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two reasons. First, still getting a lot of things in place on the backend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are now into September and people are winding down from summer. Plus we want to make it more official during <strong><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCampUS 2024</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot of plans for this blog and to model it after our podcast, a blog for the community, by the community.

How are you doing, man? All good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I&#8217;m good, I&#8217;m good. Monday morning. Got to do some work today using New Relic to troubleshoot WooCommerce. So maybe there’ll be some stuff to talk about with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Oh wow. Alright, today’s a very special episode. We are excited to introduce Vedanshu Jain. He&#8217;s a senior software engineer and a key contributor to the WooCommerce project at Automattic. I guess for the last six years, but he&#8217;ll correct me if I did the math correctly. Lately, he has been concentrating on scaling and performance. He plays a pivotal role in leading the HPOS project. Also, we did talk about the pronunciation of HPOS, if that’s the correct way to pronounce it or not. We’re going to be corrected in a minute. He’s also worked on numerous performance enhancements and has helped many merchants fine-tune their sites to handle greater scale. So let&#8217;s dive into his insights. Welcome to the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Hello, hello. Very happy to be here. So yeah, I have been working for six years now at Automattic, which is more than half a decade. So yeah, that’s a lot. HPOS, I guess I pronounce it HPOS, but I do not think we have an official pronunciation. So I suppose as long as we can communicate, it’s fine, but it can get a little bit hard to figure out what you’re talking about. H-P-O-S, it’s all the same. No problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right? Well, there are many ways to pronounce it, and most of the people we talk to about HPOS or HPOS, they go and say, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Regardless of the way that you pronounce it. So I guess you’re right, we need to explain to people what that is. Would you mind explaining very quickly? I know we did an episode about this previously, but there might be some people who don’t know what we’re talking about and have the exact same response to HPOS: What the hell is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Yeah, so HPOS is basically High Performance Order Storage. What we did with that project is that WooCommerce by default used to store order data in posts and post meta tables using custom post types, which is a feature in WordPress. It’s a great feature, and we have been quite successful users of that feature, like WooCommerce and many other plugins in general. But orders specifically can grow really fast. For a successful site, you can have hundreds, thousands, and millions of orders, and then storing them all in posts and post meta tables means that different operations on the site are going to compete with all this bulk of orders for all their normal operations, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it’s the same table, it’s the same data storage. So what HPOS does is it stores just the order data in different tables so that your posts and post meta tables are free to serve your post content, to serve the site’s content, products, attributes, and all those other things. So in a sense, it makes your site faster, but maybe that’s not a super accurate way to say it. I think a more accurate way to say it is that it’ll make your site more scalable. So when you’re receiving this bulk of orders, your site will not be slowed down just because there are millions of entries in the post meta table due to orders or just because of the orders that you’re receiving. So it sets your site up for easier scaling for your growth, and yeah, that’s what the whole project is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Great. Do you think this is for all merchants out there using WooCommerce? Is this for just people who have a hundred thousand orders? Is this for people who are just starting out and need to activate this no matter what? What is your recommendation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So if you are starting out, I 100% recommend that you start with HPOS because you are going to hit growth—or at least you want to hit growth—or at least we hope that you’re going to hit that growth, and then you will need it. So it doesn’t make sense when you’re starting out to not start with HPOS because everything else is the same; everything else is equivalent. You will have very similar interfaces; you have all the major plugins already providing support with HPOS, so you have the same experience. So for the shops that are starting out, I highly recommend starting with HPOS, which is also the default. If you set up a new site with WooCommerce now, you will start on HPOS. Additionally, for shops that are hitting growth or shops that are already using custom post types because they have been in business for some time now, I do recommend that you consider switching to HPOS whenever you can because if you don’t—or let’s say you don’t have time now—then when you hit growth, you would want to do it, and then you would do it in a bit of a stressful situation because orders are coming in, the site is slowing down, and now you want to start planning it. It would be a bit more stressful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you can plan it early, that’s really great because that’s what we are trying to get everyone towards, which is just an HPOS-based future. We do want people to scale well. We do want people to have great experiences with WooCommerce at any stage of growth. So yeah, I recommend HPOS if you start out, but also if you already have a shop that’s on custom post types, plan your migration when you can plan it without stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right. Most people don’t have HPOS activated by default, I guess I would say. And most people are also afraid to activate it if they already have a store and it’s a big store. I didn’t want to talk too much about this, but I think it’s a good way just again to remind people about how great of a feature this is. Would you still recommend people to invest a small amount of time in activating it? And would you say it is hard or very easy to activate HPOS?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />We do understand the complexity involved in it. So you’re basically on a live site, you’re basically replacing one of the key components of that site. You’re basically replacing where very critical data is being stored live. Understandably, it’s a bit daunting and intimidating. The good thing is we have in-built rollback mechanisms, which means that you can switch to HPOS, you can try it out, you can verify if it works fine. In a situation where it does not work fine, the rollback is possible. So from the interface itself, you can switch back to post tables, and then everything would be as it was before. So we do have some safeguards. We do have some fail-safe mechanisms, which basically mean that even if you found some issue or even if you find that you do not have the time anymore or even if you—or for whatever reason—want to switch back, you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing is that you do try to make some time here and give it a shot. So we also have a guide on the WooCommerce blog which tells you some steps that, if you’re running a high-volume site, what you can do or the series of steps that you can perform, some basic testing, some testing on staging, and then how you disable. So when you switch to HPOS for the first time from a shop that is using post storage, we would be writing data to both post and HPOS tables. So there is a series of steps that you can disable this sync methodologically. So this way, basically, you would have some ramp from post to HPOS, and if something goes wrong, you can go back to post again, and that guide will detail all that—what you can do, what you should do, what you should test for, and what you should expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Actually, the reason why we got to Vedanshu in the first place was a very interesting one because Mike had this client who had this very particular use case, and he was asking me, &#8220;Do you know somebody?&#8221; And I did know somebody else that works at Automattic and managed a lot of the WooCommerce-related projects. It was very interesting to ask Darren about, &#8220;Hey, we have this particular issue. Mike has this client. We would like to talk to somebody who can give us an answer, or at least a very comforting answer, about the way that we can solve this particular problem.&#8221; Mike, do you want to share a little bit about this story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, we mentioned it briefly in the first podcast, and it’s a Shark Tank client who gets a lot of orders. They had moved to HPOS but still had the backward compatibility thing enabled. I was doing… They wanted a backend troubleshooting project done, and they were having weird delays, and I noticed this consistent query that was showing up that was taking 40 seconds. I remember asking you on the way to go play squash, Marcel, and you were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, those are the HPOS tables. They shouldn’t be taking that long.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, the whole benefit of introducing HPOS was that search queries and things like that were supposed to get way faster.&#8221; I think you had a client as well who had a similar challenge, and we were trying to gather data. I tried rewriting the queries to make them more precise</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so they weren’t using likes or wildcards and that kind of stuff, and it still didn’t really make that much of a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then we went on this adventure to figure out who can help us answer this. This is not what was supposed to happen. Then we met Vedanshu at the WooCommerce party in Turin, and you said, &#8220;Oh, there’s this new feature with these indexes that we are adding in WooCommerce 9.00 beta 2, which should speed that up significantly.&#8221; I think a week or two later, I managed to get it tested, and the same queries ended up taking a hundred milliseconds, and I was like, &#8220;Ha, it works!&#8221; And Vedanshu was so confident at the party—I don’t know if you remember—he was like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, just install this. It should be way better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I do remember, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Marcel and I were both a little bit skeptical, we’re not going to lie, because we were like, &#8220;How is it going to go from 40 seconds to anything acceptable? There’s a long way down to two or three seconds.&#8221; So yeah, we were very pleasantly surprised to see that it made things significantly faster. We were curious about how you go into researching, developing, proposing, and sort of testing. That’s a major change because building a separate index for all of the order emails and stuff like that so it’s basically instant—that doesn’t sound like it’s something you just snap your fingers and it magically gets done. So I’m curious what that process is like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So I think for the context, you’re talking about the HPOS text search, which is basically full-text search in MySQL. This is something that we wanted to do for a long time, even before HPOS, but the structure, but our way of storing data where we would store data in the post meta tables, was a blocker for us to do it because you cannot add this index on the entirety of the post meta table because it would make your space requirements for the database or RAM requirements go way up. So I guess for research, even before HPOS, one of the things that we researched is what would be possible because just changing the database structure without leveraging the features of that structure is not going to just speed up the site. But what you would get with this sort of architecture change is basically collateral gains, which means that even just by changing that data structure, nothing happens by default. You would need to write those queries, you would need to build those in, and you would need to do some work on top of it to actually take advantage of this new structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, we decided to have this addressable separately so that we can apply an FTS index on it. So yeah, I guess it depends on doing some planning ahead on what you want to do with this feature once it’s out, once it’s built. This is something that a normalized structure would allow you to do, is that you can add more indexes, you can add very specific indexes on the data structure or on the query requirements that you have. FTS is one example, but there are some more. For example, for many shops, they might be querying some specific column more often than the other ones. Even if WooCommerce does not provide a default index on that column specifically, the merchant can add it, or the developers can add it. So for research, we take a look at what we can do right now, what are the things that are blocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even with post meta, you can scale a site quite well. You have been in business for quite a while, and you would know that even with posts and post meta, you would have experienced that you can scale a site quite well. It’s just that there are some things where this structure would start becoming a blocker. There are some features that you cannot explore anymore. You can still work around it. For example, you could stream the order data to Elasticsearch and provide the search from there. You could do many workarounds, but it’s not straightforward, it’s not simple enough, it’s not something that works out of the box. So this is that we actually did figure out what we wanted. Even if you see the issue—like the issue for the FTS index—it opened two years back when HPOS was still in planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We opened the issue then that this is something that we would do once HPOS has rolled out. There are some more enhancements that we still have in mind, and hopefully, we would be able to roll those out soon enough. But yeah, we try to look at what is currently possible, what is currently not possible with the existing structure, what are the blockers, and try to figure out how we go from there. But FTS and index is something that’s been on our mind for a bit now. I think for the WordPress core project too, they also have an issue open to add FTS indexes for post content and the main post table so that you are able to search post content way more faster than you can right now. But yeah…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />How would you test something like that? So let’s say, for example, you get your team together and you decide, &#8220;Oh, let’s do these indexes, this full-text index thing, and we have now a new table, and we’re going to turn this on,&#8221; and now you go, &#8220;Yeah, but first to make a decision, I would imagine that you have to base it on results, and you have to have some data that will back up the decision about activating or proposing for everybody to activate this.&#8221; I know how well most people probably have their MySQL database settings set up in a way that it’s possible to use it, but how would you go about measuring the success of something like this and say with confidence now for everybody that this is going to benefit everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So for testing, the primary testbed is some of the test sites that we have, that we host on. So basically they’re hosted on WordPress.com. Some of those sites have about 1 million orders or 600,000 orders, and we primarily test against… So that’s the first step in feature development. We would build these queries, we would manually create these indexes using direct MySQL queries, try to run queries, compare the differences, and see if it’s something that’s worthwhile to pursue. If it is, then we would try to build it into a feature, and then we would do this testing that we are doing right now. So currently, FTS indexes are marked as experimental. One of the things that currently actually blocks it from graduating, or sort of graduating away from experimental to enable by default, is that in some specific versions, we find that the results are inconsistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do not recall exactly, but anyway, I think from MySQL version 8.2.0.24 to 8.2.0.31, you will see that the site will be unable to create this index because of a MySQL bug, which was then fixed in 8.2.0.35. Okay, so this is something we learned. Once we have this package, once we have this in experimental, we do not know how it’ll go. We got these reports that this person is not able to create this index on the site, we go and try to debug, and then we find out that okay, this is some MySQL bug, and you have to upgrade a MySQL version to actually have this working. So once you put a feature in experimental, we try to make some noise about it or try to have more people use it. Some people would have great experiences like you have, and then some people will find out some edge cases and report them back to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we would eventually graduate the feature when we are confident that we have resolved most of the edge cases. We know that this feature will not break sites just on upgrading. We know that this feature will not break sites just on enabling it. So this is the same process we followed for HPOS. We had an experimental mode for quite a long time. We made a lot of noise about it. We requested people to try it out. Some people had great experiences, some people reported bugs, and we tried to fix them as much as we can. Eventually, you’ll see that once you release something as experimental, you get a lot of bug reports soon. Depending on how big the feature is, you will get bug reports very soon, and then they will start to drop off. Once they sort of stabilize, once you have fixed all the high-priority bugs, you can mark that feature as stable. This is something that we did for HPOS; this is something that we are doing for FTS indexes. But actually, FTS indexes are quite stable. There are some edge cases—there is another edge case around phone numbers, which it is not able to search properly, which is something that I actually have on my list to look into today. But other than that, it seems quite stable. Hopefully, we will be able to graduate it soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I guess also indexes are a feature of the database engine. It’s not something or some code that you guys wrote and are experimenting with like it is with HPOS, right? You sort of trust the engineers who created the database engine on it working as it should be, as it was created for. I imagine it would be kind of easier to make the decision in terms of activating that as opposed to HPOS, which is—or HPOS, I’m going to call it HPOS for the rest of the podcast—just shorter. It’s shorter. It’s the way that we’ve been talking about it the whole time, so it’s very hard for me to change it. Where you have this synchronization</p>\n\n\n\n<p>going on, you have important data copying. I imagine that is a much harder update to do than just the index, right? Let’s imagine the following: You were sitting down in front of a computer, you were talking to some friends, and somebody came up and said, &#8220;Hey, I have this great idea to build something for WordPress that is an e-commerce platform, and let’s call it, for example, WooCommerce.&#8221; What would you architect differently in terms of the database in comparison to today? So if you were to be able to, at day zero, decide on the architecture of the database, what would you do differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Okay, so that’s a very interesting question. I also wanted to talk a little bit about what you said earlier about the FTS indexes. So FTS index is one of MySQL’s features. You can do a CREATE INDEX statement and have it enabled, but it’s a little bit more complex because it has a lot of tuning parameters. For example, you can specify… Right now we have configured it to work on natural language, so it would split words based on spaces, apostrophes, and all the natural language separators. But you can also create just trigrams or n-grams. You can configure it to behave more similar to Elasticsearch. So there are some configuration parameters that you can play around with depending on the use case of your site. So this experimental time is also meant for us to figure out what the optimized state of tuning for that feature is, which we may end up changing based on the feedback that we get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But otherwise, it’s much more stable than HPOS because we trust the developers of MySQL very much. It’s an extremely great piece of software. Right, okay. So if you think about the journey of WooCommerce, the CPT integration with custom post types gave it, in my opinion, a much-needed lift when it needed it. Developers understand custom post types; developers understand playing around with it, extending it, modifying its API. So integrating it with custom post types rather than building a new table from the start I think was a good decision—or at least in my opinion—because it allows you to, first of all, build it really quickly because then you do not have to create all these custom queries. You do not have to manage the caching around it. You do not have to do a lot of things. WordPress will do the heavy lifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you don’t even need to create an admin interface. You don’t even need to worry about access controls, security, performance, and so many things that are just taken care of for you, including the programmatic API to access it. So it’s extremely powerful, and I think at that point, using custom post types even for orders was the right choice. For a new project, for everything new, if I were sitting in a friend circle—maybe we were at a campfire roasting some marshmallows—if someone tells me that we are doing this new thing, I would use as much existing functionality as I can, or at least… So depending on who you ask, depending on what developer you ask, this is probably going to change. I think for any product, there is no singular success path. For every product, it’s going to be different, and you can make a product work using all parts, or a product will not work even if you have the best architecture—it’s implementation details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don’t know, in my opinion, I would use WordPress features as much as I can and build custom functionality when I have to. But when you see this scale, unless WordPress starts coming in the way, I don’t think that I would engineer a feature to work around it or to bypass it. The other case is if the philosophy of what WordPress provides is completely different from what the feature intends to do, which it kind of is in the case of orders because they’re never going to be published to the world—the post is eventually supposed to be published to the world, an order will not. So it diverges from the philosophy a little bit, but then I would try to use as many WordPress features as I can because it would allow our team to start quickly, prototype directly on top of it, and then once the product is successful, then we can worry about scale. We can worry about what we want to do exactly—or, well, not what we want to do, but what’s the best structure for it and how do we support our customers who are growing very well, how do we support our clients who are doing very well, and we should not get in the way of their growth just for our growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />The biggest challenge we have with databases is their size, I would say. Right? How big of a deal is it to have gigantic table sizes? I don’t know. We deal with 4 million rows, 6 million rows in post meta sometimes. Is that a big deal? Is that not so much? What would you say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So disk storage is not that much of a concern as big of a concern as memory is—like available memory is. MySQL will try to load everything into memory. It’ll try to load all the indexes into memory, and if allowed, it would load everything, which is fine, which works great for the case that MySQL does for us. As a database designer, it means that our indexes are smart. We are not normalizing data too much. For example, in post meta, you have this meta key and meta value. This meta key is repeated thousands of times because every order is going to have the same meta keys, right? By converting it to columns, you’re reducing the amount that MySQL needs to load because—this is kind of oversimplifying—but it doesn’t need to load that string anymore. It knows that this is this column; it knows that this column is called whatever, and it knows all the values that belong to this column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the amount of data that MySQL will put into RAM decreases with this denormalization—it comes into play. I wouldn’t say that it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t say that the space doesn’t matter, or I wouldn’t say that the size of the database doesn’t matter. It does matter. So first, with a bigger database, MySQL needs to have… With a denormalized database such as post meta, it would need to put more data into the RAM. But then also when it queries the data, it needs to scan through more rows; it needs to filter through more rows. So that also slows different parts of your site down. It’s a concern, but you can solve it in the sense that… One option is you can throw money at the server, but at some point, it gets tricky because there’s some limit to it, or that limit can hit really fast, really soon when the data explodes. So it’s a concern, but it’s not a concern when you’re starting up, when you’re developing this new product—or this is just my very subjective opinion. Many people will disagree with that—but it’ll definitely be a concern as you grow. It’ll definitely be a concern as you start to grow, as you start to acquire more customers or more data. And yeah, it would be a problem eventually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Hopefully… In Danish, we call those luxury problems. Hopefully, if you’re making that many orders, you’re also making money, and hopefully enough of that is profit to be able to allocate to solving this issue. So I’m curious, how much extra RAM is necessary for the FTS indexes on a site with a million orders? Is there any calculation or preparation people should do to make sure MySQL won’t crash because it runs out of memory?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I actually tried to measure it during my testing, but I wasn’t able to. MySQL would always use the same amount of RAM, but I think that’s because of the testing conditions that I wanted. That’s mostly because I wasn’t able to create this testing condition where it would load more data. Maybe it was doing something behind the scenes that wasn’t observable, but I suppose that it would definitely need more RAM. It cannot… Even though just because I wasn’t able to observe it doesn’t mean that it’s not loading more RAM, but what it internally does is that it creates these words. For example, in your address, if you have, say, &#8220;221B Baker Street,&#8221; then it’ll have this row &#8220;221B,&#8221; it’ll have this row &#8220;Baker,&#8221; it would have this row &#8220;Street,&#8221; and then in each of these rows, it would store IDs of all the different order IDs where &#8220;221B,&#8221; &#8220;Baker,&#8221; or &#8220;Street&#8221; come in. So it’s not inefficient, it’s actually… It’s quite a good data structure, as we trust the developers of MySQL. It’s a pretty good data structure. It should have some additional RAM requirements, but I do not know what that is, or at least in my testing or in my research that I did, I wasn’t able to find this exact number that I can point out that this is what it’s going to need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />If you were testing on WordPress.com too, that would make it more challenging—a big multisite, right? The database is shared?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />No, so for the RAM, I was actually testing it on my local setup to actually see how much the requirement increases so that I can actually figure out the memory used by that exact process. So that’s why I said that it should have some additional RAM requirements, but I wasn’t able to actually establish how much. I hope that MySQL would have some documentation somewhere that tells you this, but it would also really depend on how different your database is. For example, if all the customers live on Baker</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Street, it’s not going to be a lot because it would find those repetitions. If your customers live all across the world with different addresses, the natural language… If it’s not able to index those words properly, if everything is different, then it would have a lot more requirement than it would by just when the addresses are more normalized. So maybe the RAM requirements cannot be as straightforwardly established as we can do it for other data structures, but it’s efficient, I hope. I guess, all that we have seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Ideally, if you have a database that is two gigabytes, you have two gigabytes of RAM, right? Just load everything into memory, it’ll work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />But then, Mike, you did test it out, right? Did you notice anything about how much additional requirement it imposed on your server?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />So on this particular server, it’s huge—64 gigs of RAM—and there’s a lot of it allocated. I think over 30 gigs of RAM is allocated to MySQL, so we didn’t need to make any adjustments basically. One of the reasons I moved them to that host was so that they had plenty of room for growth because they get so many orders per day, and their live site and staging site share the same server. So I would’ve had to get them to buy an extra airplane because it’s a dedicated physical server. It’s a bit more complicated than just spinning up an extra instance. But I’m having a meeting with them actually this week, so if I get any… When I told them I was going to speak with you, they were really excited because stores at this level… When they don’t want to move away to something like Shopify or something else, when things are working, their team is well-versed in WooCommerce and is trained in it now. So they don’t want to migrate away. Having someone who is very much working inside of core and knows what new developments are on the horizon helps give them a lot of confidence that WooCommerce can scale and can handle their multimillion-dollar business. Those are probably the kind of customers WooCommerce wants to keep happy, you would think, for the benefits of keeping the project alive for the very long term, so that it fits customers of all sizes—just starting out and those who have the luxury problem of that kind of growth and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Do you see a future where WooCommerce would be a standalone version of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Currently, I think it’s too coupled. So anything can happen in the future—I won’t say that nothing is impossible—but I think currently WooCommerce is too coupled with WordPress to be standalone anytime soon, at least. We rely on WordPress to… For example, the product relies on WordPress a lot because they are a post type that does get published. But then we rely on WordPress for role-based access control. We rely on WordPress for the whole admin backend. We rely on WordPress for a lot of things. I think there is a very nice future for WooCommerce within the WordPress ecosystem and for the WordPress ecosystem itself. But I would not say that there would be a standalone WooCommerce soon enough, although I do not see it immediately, at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, the reason I ask has to do with what we were talking about and having these bigger clients come in. It’s hard for us as freelancers, for example, to come up with a big client and say to them why they wouldn’t migrate away from WooCommerce because they know that the concept of WooCommerce is… It is a plugin that is for WordPress, and WordPress is content management software that is more for… Well, it’s kind of strange to say that it is for blog posts and for running a blog, but it’s for so many things right now. But basically, what people understand when they have to make a decision is that they have these dedicated platforms that are just solely there for the purpose of having an online store. And then you have something that you attach to another thing, and that enables you to sell your products online as well. So it kind of makes it a little bit harder for us to sell the idea. Although honestly, WooCommerce is so popular right now that most of these big ones don’t even ask those questions anymore. But there are some numbers that say that WooCommerce is mostly spread in smaller stores than in bigger stores. So for people to make the jump and to decide about WooCommerce, wouldn’t it be better if you would be saying that you are installing WooCommerce and not WordPress? You know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So this is something for the marketing team to really answer, but I don’t know. I’ve always seen WordPress as an asset because I understand that even for a person who is primarily here for commerce, who primarily wants to use WooCommerce for commerce, they would eventually want to publish their product. They would eventually want to have… Or maybe not everyone, but in a majority of cases, they would want to publish their products. They would want to do SEO on them. They would want to have good SEO for their site. They would want to have their site look beautiful, use nice themes. They would want to have a membership area, have customers’ accounts, my account pages, and all of those things. They are something that we derive from WordPress. Even if you take a look at a WooCommerce and WordPress installation as WooCommerce first, there are a lot of things that are essential for a commerce shop that we derive from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The features that WooCommerce uses from WordPress are not small; it’s huge. We pretty much use almost all the functionality that WordPress has to offer. An e-commerce site will pretty much use all the functionality that WordPress has to offer. I think that’s an asset, right? Because not just the functionality, but it also means that there are more experts in the ecosystem. There is more knowledge in the ecosystem, there is a bigger community. There is so much that we gain from WordPress. If we had to make WooCommerce standalone, we would have to implement all these things again that we currently just get from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />It would have to be a fork of WordPress and then put WooCommerce on top of it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Yep, yep. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I like to ask these questions that are challenging, that you haven’t had time to think about them before. I think that’s the most fun about it. If you had a magic wand, what would you change in WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />That’s an interesting one. So I do not have a magic wand—I really wish I did. As someone working on performance, I feel that currently people have to understand the platform a bit as they grow. For example, they would change servers, maybe they would migrate to different machines, they would integrate different technologies. There are some milestones that happen as you grow. This is the same, right? Migrating to a different server or a bigger server, integrating Elasticsearch, integrating some different technologies, figuring out if you’re at a stage where you want to look into horizontal scaling, and things like that. If I had a magic wand, I think I would make this super clear or I would have it done magically that, &#8220;Okay, now I need this,&#8221; so this just happens. &#8220;I need this,&#8221; this just happens. So again, this is with a caveat that this is my limited perspective, but I think people are not that worried about additional cost as they grow because as Mike says, it’s a luxury problem. You want to have these problems, but having to replatform is annoying. It’s a distraction away from your main business. It’s something… It’s a chore. So I wish that we had something that just scales you up as you go, figures out where you want to go, and just takes you there and everything is just perfect all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Some notices appearing on the dashboard saying, &#8220;Now that you have a thousand customers, this would be advisable,&#8221; or… Well, who knows? Maybe AI will come in and help some of these clients scale a little bit better because some of these issues are repeatable, so they’re all the same for all clients. It’s kind of like there should already be some tool out there that allows us to give some automatic tips on how to improve the store and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Maybe you just click on a button and you are now on the server that you need at that point in your growth journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Well, to my defense, I would say we need two, but one is an automatic one and the other is &#8220;hire an expert.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />For the &#8220;hire an expert.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you find that clients take for granted the technological resource portion of running a store? I find in my own experience that it’s like buying a car. They buy the car and they’re like, &#8220;This should just run forever, no matter how many people I’m putting in it, how much crap I want to transport.&#8221; And when things stop working, they get very confused. They’re like, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; And I say, &#8220;Well, you’ve got to maintain the thing. If your family has doubled in size, maybe you want to get a bigger car.&#8221; It’s something that I find that non-technical store owners just… It’s like a shock for them. Some elasticity is required in growth and rebuilding and stuff. I was wondering if you found something similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I can understand that as a customer or as a user of the product, you may think that way. But as you mentioned, it’s not that simple. In India, there’s this thing called—we call it Chota</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hathi. It’s basically a small pickup truck, the miniature version of a pickup truck, and you can use it to haul and carry stuff from your warehouse to your frontend stores or whatever it is. When you start, you buy this Chota Hathi, and then you can outgrow it as you grow. Suddenly it’s not enough. You have to make too many rounds; you cannot carry that much stuff anymore, or you need to carry much more stuff. So you need to buy a bigger one. You need to buy a proper pickup truck. You need to eventually buy a fleet of them when you get super successful. It’s the same with WooCommerce as well. You can start with a very small investment, and then you can grow it as much as you can or as much as you want to. This is something that we are actually trying to… So we actually just published a blog post on, I think, Friday. It’s called &#8220;Scaling with WooCommerce,&#8221; which helps you with this path that when you start out, the principle of WooCommerce is that you can run it on a very small basic server, but it’ll take you to wherever you need to go with the help of magic wands, which we call experts in the community. That’s the main principle. This engine and this truck bed, that’s all you need, and you can add more of these if you need it. You can buy a bigger one, or… All sorts of vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, integrating other technologies, or whatever milestones there are, you can do that. That’s the focus from our side. But that said, I also understand that, &#8220;I buy a small truck and I expect it to carry everything for me forever.&#8221; The difference is that in a physical shop, it’s easy to see that you cannot fit more than 400 kgs or some unit of it more than that on this small truck. So you need to buy a new one, or you need to buy a bigger one, or you need to buy more of them. It’s not super clear in software because, in software, you click and something happens. So that’s something that is a perception that we want to tackle, but you will see that as you grow, even if you want a bigger truck or even if you want a fleet, it’ll give you a very nice return. You will be in charge of everything, and it’ll give you a much better return on your investment as you grow your business because these are the things that you are using to grow the business. So we are trying to change the perception of it. But yeah, I do understand that with software… Someone at least, even me, I just download it and it should take me to the moon, but that’s going to need a bit more work than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />That’s awesome. We do have a lot of experience with customers like that, who just expect things to work. And also the other way around—they don’t expect to pay that much because they thought it should work in the first place. Sometimes we go in and say, &#8220;Yeah, but this needs fine-tuning and this and that.&#8221; And they say, &#8220;Yeah, but then I have to spend money, and it doesn’t make any sense.&#8221; Well, it does make a lot of sense. In the blog post you were just talking about, &#8220;Scaling with WooCommerce,&#8221; it’s really about that. It’s about different ways you can scale and how your growth and how the profit that you have… How much you should spend some of that into scaling well. It’s a very hard lesson to give to people, and that’s why case studies are so important—to show people how others did and how directly relatable it is for websites that run faster, how it converts better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s measurable. That’s something that, for example, Mike also has on his website—a tool to calculate that. So it’s very obvious to us that this is relatable, but it’s sometimes hard to explain that to other people. Do you think WooCommerce needs to have more case studies of the bigger clients where we can really point to them and say, &#8220;Look, WooCommerce is used in this million-dollar company, it’s used on that website&#8221;? Because with WordPress, we do this a little bit—we do tell people who are the big institutions and companies who use WordPress. I personally think WooCommerce misses that a little bit. Do you think that’s the case as well? And I know this is more marketing than performance, but it’s sort of related, right? It’s like, &#8220;Look, this is a website that has a thousand orders a day; you can do it as well. So your decision with having five orders a day today is a good one because you can scale it to a thousand a day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I think it would be helpful, yeah. So this is, as you said, marketing, but we do have customers that use WooCommerce on some crazy scales, and it could make a lot of sense to document their journey if they’re fine with it and tell people that they’re using it. Tell people what scale they have, how they’re managing it, what their average request times are, what their conversion is, and things like that. I think it would be helpful. Let me see if I can ask some people inside to see if we can do this sort of marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, I think it’s very important, and this is the first thing people ask us: &#8220;Yeah, but do you have any examples?&#8221; and all of that. Obviously, Mike, being an expert, is more oriented toward this performance tuning part of the business. Mike does a very great job in writing case studies and almost automatically selling the idea that if you increase performance, you gain in sales. And yeah, I think that’s a very important part, and WooCommerce, I think, misses that a little bit, which we should definitely be investing more in—talking about these clients that I’m talking about. I’ve worked with some of them as well, and some of them… WooCommerce coming over to Codeable and asking for freelancers to work on these bigger clients because they have these bigger challenges. I was surprised to know, &#8220;Oh, this business? I know this business,&#8221; and I’m not living in the USA, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m not supposed to know all the small, medium businesses and names that they have over there that have ads on the television and all of that. So there’s a culture around the businesses that is more US-oriented than in the rest of the world. But there are some other names who come over to this side of the world, and they get their brands and names over here. Some of them I say, &#8220;Oh, this website runs WooCommerce? Oh, that website runs WooCommerce?&#8221; So it’s kind of a surprise for me, and I question… It shouldn’t be a surprise for me as it shouldn’t be a surprise for anybody else. I think there’s something that needs to be done in terms of telling everybody, like all the other competing platforms do, right? They do announce who the brands are that are using them. I think it’s very beneficial if they would do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I’ve found the challenge is often that… With the Shark Tank client, they made me sign an NDA. They don’t want me to publicize who they are because once it’s a business, there’s money involved, there’s competition, and people are always looking for a technical edge or a way to… &#8220;How are they doing it?&#8221; If you keep your competitors stuck on trying to figure out the technical puzzle, it takes away their resources from being able to compete in other areas that might be challenging for you to keep up with. So I think part of it, unfortunately, is just business and the nature of it, and trying to keep things competitive and keep your profit margins and your market share. It’s way easier for me to get people who just use WordPress for the blog or the content production… They’re happy to brag about how many visits they’re getting and how much things got better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as soon as they’re selling a product, it becomes… Yeah, they seem way more hesitant. So maybe giving them incentives might help. I think that making this connection with the WooCommerce core team helps provide a… Like, &#8220;Hey, we’d like to share your story. You’ll still be anonymous, but we’d like to get some numbers out there.&#8221; It helps build some trust, I think, and confidence in WooCommerce as a product for the long term. We’ll see if we can help make something like that happen. I don’t know if you experience that as well, Marcel, with… If you want to write a case study or publish things that… They’re like, &#8220;Hey, you can say…&#8221; I change the names, and I usually don’t use the company name unless they say it’s okay. And it’s very rare that they say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, there’s this concern about giving away some critical information that they took months or years to accumulate. Then simply there’s another developer who comes in and just talks about all the tricks and all the things that… Sometimes, Mike, they don’t even want to tell that it is you who worked on this particular feature because then other companies and competitors will come to you and say, &#8220;Hey, but I’ll pay double if you do the same thing for me,&#8221; and stuff like that. I understand that, but at the same time, WooCommerce is also a business, I would say, because they want advertising in terms of what clients use, what companies use WooCommerce. Two businesses talk to each other, and as you said, Mike, they will compensate for giving away that information to each other. I think there’s… Yeah, it’s a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have obviously this challenge,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and we have NDAs, and we are more strict about talking about it because we know the nitty-gritty, and we know all the tricks, and we know what we did with the website. It would help immensely others who are struggling to scale their online shops to know how the others did it, right? That’s the whole secret about maintaining a business: &#8220;How are those guys selling ten times more than we are? What are they doing? Why is it that their website is loading in 200 milliseconds and mine is two seconds?&#8221; Yeah, I understand how challenging that can be, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Especially if you talk about scale—how many orders you are getting—it gives your competitor a direct idea of the exact revenue that you’re making, right? Or it at least gives them a ballpark, which is pretty sensitive to give away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />And what Marcel was saying too, that there are clients that don’t want me to even announce which industry they are working in because they’re like, &#8220;You’re my secret sauce. You’re my competitive advantage, and I don’t want other people to know that you’re helping me.&#8221; Then they’re going to offer you money—double, triple, or whatever—to do the same stuff. It’s tricky. It’s very flattering; it’s a very nice compliment. But at the same time, I think when you get into freelancing and helping WooCommerce stores with performance and user experience and all of that, you’re interested in making the internet a more enjoyable place for people to shop and do stuff. If you’re sort of restricted to doing that for fewer people, it feels weird—it doesn’t feel like you’re fulfilling your mission, I guess, in the same way as you’d ideally like to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />100%, definitely. Vedanshu, we would have a thousand more questions to ask you. We would probably get much more technical in our questions than our audience would like us to get. But we would like to thank you very much for participating in today’s episode. It was a pleasure having you. We’re definitely going to keep in contact because, yeah, this is what we love to do. We love to have these connections with people who are, first of all, smarter than we are; secondly, who know about what’s coming in the future and what’s happening with WooCommerce; and thirdly, because you’re very friendly and very helpful in answering our questions. This is something that we all benefit from, and therefore we thank you for your participation today. It was a pleasure having you on the episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Thank you so much. The pleasure was all mine. I wouldn’t say anything on the &#8220;smarter&#8221; bit because I think you’re all much smarter than me. But yeah, it was a pleasure being here, talking to you, and you’re all friendly too, so yeah, it makes for a nice time. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Alright, thank you so much for listening. This is our first guest that we are bringing on this new edition of Woo Have Chat. We’re going to have other guests coming up. Yeah, this is just the beginning of it, right, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Warm-up? Yeah, yeah. During this recording, I was thinking that Vedanshu is like a performance hero. He’s helping speed up WooCommerce across countless stores, and I think we need to have more friendly, approachable, passionate performance heroes on the show and have them share their experience and stuff. So I hope you’re okay with that title. We can get you a cape if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Please, please. I would go and buy a cape right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />What color should it be? Purple? WooCommerce purple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Probably, yeah, probably. Alright, we want to thank you so much for listening, and we’ll see you in the next episode.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo DevChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Marcel</strong> and <strong>Mike</strong> dive deep into the world of WooCommerce performance and scalability with <strong>Vedanshu Jain,core developer and key contributor to the WooCommerce project at Automattic</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu shares his insights on High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS), a game-changing feature designed to help WooCommerce stores handle massive volumes of orders without compromising speed. We discuss the importance of planning for growth, the challenges of adopting new technologies, and how WooCommerce can compete with dedicated e-commerce platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re building a small store or a high-traffic site, this episode is packed with valuable tips on future-proofing your WooCommerce projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage):</strong> HPOS is designed to improve the scalability and performance of WooCommerce stores by storing order data in separate tables instead of the default WordPress posts and post meta tables. This approach helps large-scale operations run smoothly without slowing down the site as orders increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Scalability:</strong> For new WooCommerce stores, starting with HPOS is recommended to prepare for future growth, while existing stores should consider migrating to avoid potential performance issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges with Adoption:</strong> Despite its benefits, some store owners may hesitate to activate HPOS due to concerns about potential disruptions, especially on live sites. WooCommerce addresses this by offering rollback mechanisms and guides to ensure a safe transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance Enhancements:</strong> The WooCommerce team continually works on performance improvements, such as introducing full-text search (FTS) indexes in MySQL, which significantly speeds up search queries on large datasets. These enhancements undergo extensive testing before being recommended for widespread use to ensure stability and reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real-World Testing and Feedback</strong>: Features like FTS indexes are initially released as experimental to gather real-world feedback and identify edge cases before being marked as stable. The WooCommerce team relies on testing both in controlled environments and on real, high-traffic sites to ensure the robustness of new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WooCommerce vs. Dedicated E-commerce Platforms: </strong>WooCommerce’s integration with WordPress offers many advantages, including flexibility and access to a vast ecosystem of plugins and themes. However, there is a perception challenge when comparing WooCommerce, which is a WordPress plugin, with dedicated e-commerce platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marketing and Communication</strong>: To combat the perception that WooCommerce is only suitable for smaller stores, the platform could benefit from highlighting successful large-scale implementations through case studies. These would play a crucial role in showcasing WooCommerce’s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Planning for Growth</strong>: As stores grow, they need to plan for increased server resources, potential platform changes, and other scaling challenges. Early planning can help avoid stress and ensure smooth growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in Sharing Success Stories</strong>: While case studies can be valuable, many successful businesses are reluctant to share details due to competitive reasons, including revealing their technical strategies and performance enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WooCommerce’s Future Direction</strong>: WooCommerce is deeply integrated with WordPress, and while there are no immediate plans to separate it, the team is focused on enhancing its scalability and performance within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Links</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedanshuj/\">Vedanshu on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vedjain/\">Vedanshu on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/\">High-Performance Order Storage Documentation on Woo</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/08/22/scaling-with-woocommerce/\">Scaling with WooCommerce</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search.html\">Full-Text Search Functions with MySQL</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 09:08:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 05:47:59 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 05:30:27 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20240820110034\";}','off'),(1137,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1726595279','off'),(1138,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1726552079','off'),(1139,'_transient_timeout_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','1726595279','off'),(1140,'_transient_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/episode-86-my-first-wordpress-experience/\'>WP Briefing: Episode 86: My First WordPress Experience</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/tour-the-new-learn-wordpress/\'>Tour the New Learn WordPress</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://dothewoo.io/learn-about-wordcamp-sydney-with-wil-brown/\'>Do The Woo Community: Learn About WordCamp Sydney with Wil Brown</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/woosesh-2024-scheduled-for-october-29-and-30\'>WPTavern: WooSesh 2024 Scheduled for October 29 and 30</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2024-is-almost-here\'>WPTavern: WordCamp US 2024 is Almost Here</a></li></ul></div>','off'),(1141,'updraftplus_dismisseddashnotice','1758174481','on'),(1151,'_transient_timeout_acf_pro_validating_license','1726558932','off'),(1152,'_transient_acf_pro_validating_license','1','off'),(1156,'_site_transient_timeout_theme_roots','1726562436','off'),(1157,'_site_transient_theme_roots','a:2:{s:4:\"sage\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:16:\"twentytwentyfour\";s:7:\"/themes\";}','off'),(1160,'_site_transient_timeout_wp_theme_files_patterns-b89aad8de1856ce4f583cda9a4583d60','1726565349','off'),(1161,'_site_transient_wp_theme_files_patterns-b89aad8de1856ce4f583cda9a4583d60','a:2:{s:7:\"version\";s:6:\"10.8.2\";s:8:\"patterns\";a:0:{}}','off');
